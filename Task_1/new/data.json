While a high volume of literary evidence on this Islamic social finance instrument is available, the research motivation and study findings are diverse. Therefore, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of waqf literature to understand the pattern and direction of research on Waqf broadly. We collect 319 articles, and reviews on Waqf extracted from the Scopus database, covering a period exceeding 100 years from 1914 until June 2020. We employ RStudio, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel for citation analysis, content, and network analyses. A systematic review of recent publications complemented the bibliometric analysis. Alongside revealing the most relevant scientific actors in waqf literature, most researchers on Waqf were from Malaysia; they conducted studies widely on cash Waqf. As a result, we identify four research themes for waqf studies which include (1) Cash Waqf endowment, (2) Islamic accountability and Waqf, (3) Waqf and Islamic social finance, and (4) Governance for Waqf endowment. This is the first study to provide a bibliometric review of waqf literature to address gaps in the existing research and offer directions for future research which could benefit early-career Islamic finance researchers.", "filtered_title": ["bibliometr", "review", "waqf", "literatur", "muneer", "alshat", "kabir", "hassan", "mamunur", "rashid", "rashedul", "hasan", "waqf", "receiv", "research", "attent", "due", "abil", "contribut", "socio", "econom", "develop", "high", "volum", "literari", "evid", "islam", "social", "financ", "instrument", "avail", "research", "motiv", "studi", "find", "divers", "therefor", "conduct", "bibliometr", "analysi", "waqf", "literatur", "understand", "pattern", "direct", "research", "waqf", "broad", "collect", "319", "articl", "review", "waqf", "extract", "scopus", "databas", "cover", "period", "exceed", "100", "year", "1914", "june", "2020", "employ", "rstudio", "vosview", "microsoft", "excel", "citat", "analysi", "content", "network", "analys", "systemat", "review", "recent", "public", "complement", "bibliometr", "analysi", "alongsid", "reveal", "relev", "scientif", "actor", "waqf", "literatur", "research", "waqf", "malaysia", "conduct", "studi", "wide", "cash", "waqf", "result", "identifi", "four", "research", "theme", "waqf", "studi", "includ", "1", "cash", "waqf", "endow", "2", "islam", "account", "waqf", "3", "waqf", "islam", "social", "financ", "4", "govern", "waqf", "endow", "first", "studi", "provid", "bibliometr", "review", "waqf", "literatur", "address", "gap", "exist", "research", "offer", "direct", "futur", "research", "could", "benefit", "earli", "career", "islam", "financ", "research"]}, "ba56f745-01dc-4a67-aace-a1f6b4ebe21c": {"title": "A note on COVID-19 instigated maximum drawdown in Islamic markets versus conventional counterparts", "author_name": "M.

Despite the large-scale drawdown, a number of markets secure a positive return where Islamic markets outperform the counterparts.

It employs four most commonly used theories which are then tested using 19-year banking-firm market data. The usefulness of these models demonstrates with promising results.Design/methodology/approachThis paper conducts a multi-country study using the multi-model testing approach to evaluate validity of theories and forecast accuracy of banking firms. It employs four methodology models used in finance literature; (1) P/E multiples model, (2) accounting-information-based clean surplus model, (3) theoretical model based on Gordon and Shapiro (1956) method and (4) the Damodaran-Kottler Free Cash Flow or FCF theory based on discounting model.FindingsThe tests show that the four theories under tests have a significant fit with actual price formation. The explained variation ranges from 72 to 92%, so the explanatory power of the theories accounting for variations in bank prices over 19-year period is substantial. The models fit suggest that the P/E model has superior predictive power followed by the RIM, DDM and FCFE. These findings shed new lights on the relative performance of valuation models.Research limitations/implicationsThe study is limited in terms of the sample period size for 1999\u20132019. The availability of essential financial data prior to 2000 is very limited, so one can understand interpretation of statistical results under certain assumptions.Practical implicationsThe paper suggests that one-factor model is better than the two-factor model.Originality/valueThe work done in this paper is unpublished and original contribution to banking and finance literature and also not under consideration for publication in any other journal.", "filtered_title": ["bank", "stock", "valuat", "theori", "explain", "price", "base", "theori", "ken", "yien", "leong", "moham", "ariff", "alireza", "zarei", "ishaq", "bhatti", "purposeth", "object", "paper", "investig", "valid", "stock", "valuat", "theori", "forecast", "abil", "conduct", "empir", "studi", "employ", "four", "common", "use", "theori", "test", "use", "19", "year", "bank", "firm", "market", "data", "use", "model", "demonstr", "promis", "result", "design", "methodolog", "approachthi", "paper", "conduct", "multi", "countri", "studi", "use", "multi", "model", "test", "approach", "evalu", "valid", "theori", "forecast", "accuraci", "bank", "firm", "employ", "four", "methodolog", "model", "use", "financ", "literatur", "1", "p", "e", "multipl", "model", "2", "account", "inform", "base", "clean", "surplus", "model", "3", "theoret", "model", "base", "gordon", "shapiro", "1956", "method", "4", "damodaran", "kottler", "free", "cash", "flow", "fcf", "theori", "base", "discount", "model", "findingsth", "test", "show", "four", "theori", "test", "signific", "fit", "actual", "price", "format", "explain", "variat", "rang", "72", "92", "explanatori", "power", "theori", "account", "variat", "bank", "price", "19", "year", "period", "substanti", "model", "fit", "suggest", "p", "e", "model", "superior", "predict", "power", "follow", "rim", "ddm", "fcfe", "find", "shed", "new", "light", "relat", "perform", "valuat", "model", "research", "limit", "implicationsth", "studi", "limit", "term", "sampl", "period", "size", "1999", "2019", "avail", "essenti", "financi", "data", "prior", "2000", "limit", "one", "understand", "interpret", "statist", "result", "certain", "assumpt", "practic", "implicationsth", "paper", "suggest", "one", "factor", "model", "better", "two", "factor", "model", "origin", "valueth", "work", "done", "paper", "unpublish", "origin", "contribut", "bank", "financ", "literatur", "also", "consider", "public", "journal"]}, "71565835-62bb-4a9b-840b-c1e1218b4fe6": {"title": "CEO Duality and Firm Performance: A Systematic Review and Research Agenda", "author_name": "Mei Yu", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/ceo-duality-and-firm-performance-a-systematic-review-and-research", "date": "25 May 2022", "data_desc": "This paper systematically reviews 314 empirical studies which examine the relationship between board leadership structure and firm performance.

Based on datasets covering the period from 2000 to 2012 (i.e. production quota era), analysed using the vector autoregression/vector error correction (VAR-VEC) framework, the study\u2019s results indicate that OPEC cheating, mainly instigated by the amount of spare production capacity available to OPEC members, does not seem to have a significant direct effect on international oil prices. However, the degree of cheating by OPEC member-states might disrupt its ability to maintain surplus capacity enough to reduce price speculation in the oil markets. Should cheating behaviour in OPEC continue unabated, this could jeopardise an effective energy regulatory framework and market transparency.

Design/methodology/approach: The six years of secondary data, including the annual reports of 2013\u20132018, were collected from the websites of all the seven listed Islamic banks, i.e. 100% of the population available during the period of study. The study used a content analysis approach for systematically categorizing and analysing the contents disclosed in the annual report. A total compliance score based on 133 reporting items of IFSB standard-4 were considered for content analysis. Furthermore, this study applied the ordinary least square to investigate the impact of corporate governance on IFSB standard-4. Findings: This study found that the level of compliance with the IFSB standard by the Islamic banks in Bangladesh is poor, as the overall compliance status is 44.83%. Further, this study observed a significant and positive influence of the Shari\u2019ah supervisory committee, the board size, accounting experts on the board, foreign ownership and institutional ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4. On the other hand, this study found a negative effect of directors\u2019 ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4.

We apply qualitative analysis, purposive sampling, and syntactic analysis to 34,261 articles published in 52 journals over the past two decades. First, we analyze the proliferation and historical development of topics. We find that a few topics (e.g., insurance) are losing ground to newer ones (e.g., blockchain and digital currency). However, several topics seem to occupy a stable, sizeable portion of finance literature (e.g., investment strategies and portfolio management). Next, we analyze the relationship between topics and journals and report strong tendencies that are not always confined by the traditional scope of journals. For instance, papers addressing investment strategy and portfolio management issues seem to appear in numerous journals; while special topics such as blockchain, digital currencies, dividends, and real estate can only be found in a limited number of journals. We also report strong interdependence among topics. More than a third of the papers screened in this study discuss two topics or more.

The representation of female corporate leaders increases the likelihood of fraud detection, thus reducing firms\u2019 propensity to engage in fraud. The finding confirms that women are risk averse and more committed to ethical practices than men in corporate leadership positions. Moreover, this impact of gender diversity is contingent upon the nature of ultimate controllers of listed companies: more female representation in top leadership roles can mitigate fraud commission or detect fraud effectively in non-state-owned enterprises, but not in state-owned enterprises.

Overall, our results suggest that the benefits of hiring female auditors (i.e. less accrual-based earnings management) are overwhelmingly higher than the costs they might bring to the client firms (i.e. higher real activities manipulation).", "filtered_title": ["trade", "accrual", "base", "real", "earn", "manag", "activ", "presenc", "fe", "male", "auditor", "andrew", "owusu", "alaa", "zalata", "kamil", "omoteso", "ahm", "elam", "prior", "research", "suggest", "presenc", "high", "qualiti", "auditor", "e", "proxi", "audit", "firm", "characterist", "constrain", "accrual", "base", "earn", "manag", "inadvert", "lead", "higher", "real", "activ", "manipul", "investig", "whether", "trade", "exist", "accrual", "base", "real", "earn", "manag", "activ", "presenc", "femal", "male", "auditor", "use", "sampl", "uk", "firm", "period", "2009", "2016", "find", "firm", "audit", "femal", "auditor", "resort", "higher", "level", "real", "activ", "manipul", "abil", "engag", "accrual", "manag", "constrain", "overal", "result", "suggest", "benefit", "hire", "femal", "auditor", "e", "less", "accrual", "base", "earn", "manag", "overwhelm", "higher", "cost", "might", "bring", "client", "firm", "e", "higher", "real", "activ", "manipul"]}, "faae716b-acd7-4710-bdf3-e24e2f75d379": {"title": "Kuala Lumpur - from a tin mining settlement to a neoliberal stronghold of Southeast Asia", "author_name": "Marek Kozlowski, Simon Huston", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/kuala-lumpur-from-a-tin-mining-settlement-to-a-neoliberal-strongh", "date": "22 Feb 2022", "data_desc": "Purpose: Kuala Lumpur (KL) emerged as the capital of the newly independent Federation of Malayan States in 1957 with a population of 316,000. Over the next 60 years, the city expanded into a major urban regional conurbation. It now covers an area of 2,790\u00a0km\n              2 and has a population of around 7.7 million. In the last two\u00a0decades, market-driven, fast-track development, underpinned by road infrastructure has accelerated the city's urban transformation. Especially over the last two\u00a0decades, a spate of urban redevelopments, including commercial and retail complexes, specialised centres, industrial parks, educational complexes and residential estates have transformed the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Region (KLMR) beyond recognition. KL is only one example among many of intensive Southeast Asian property-led urban development, fuelled by demographic pressures and global capital inflows that transformed the regional natural and built environments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of globalisation, neoliberalism and property-led development, on the built form and socio-cultural legacies of the KLMR. Design/methodology/approach: The major aim of this study is to determine how neoliberalism and property-led development have impacted the urban form and structure of the KLMR. The methodology applied in this study concentrates mainly on the use of qualitative research methods. The major qualitative research methods include qualitative analysis, field surveys and observations, primary and secondary data collection. The approach in this study is to exemplify the shift from government-sponsored development in the post-independence period to the current globalised-private oriented development. Findings: The major findings of this research suggest that the global, property-led mode of urban development, whilst superficially successful, undermined traditional and tropical-climate urban landscapes. It also bequeathed many urban or property level problems, including traffic congestion, air pollution, planning governance and building management issues. The paper outlines narratives for a more balanced and sustainable mode of urban development, which is more in tune with local culture and climatic conditions. Originality/value: This paper provides a deep insight analysis and evaluation of KL's growth from a small town into a global metropolitan region where property-led development dictates the rules and determines the character of the city.\n            ", "filtered_title": ["kuala", "lumpur", "tin", "mine", "settlement", "neoliber", "stronghold", "southeast", "asia", "marek", "kozlowski", "simon", "huston", "purpos", "kuala", "lumpur", "kl", "emerg", "capit", "newli", "independ", "feder", "malayan", "state", "1957", "popul", "316", "000", "next", "60", "year", "citi", "expand", "major", "urban", "region", "conurb", "cover", "area", "2", "790", "km", "2", "popul", "around", "7", "7", "million", "last", "two", "decad", "market", "driven", "fast", "track", "develop", "underpin", "road", "infrastructur", "acceler", "citi", "urban", "transform", "especi", "last", "two", "decad", "spate", "urban", "redevelop", "includ", "commerci", "retail", "complex", "specialis", "centr", "industri", "park", "educ", "complex", "residenti", "estat", "transform", "kuala", "lumpur", "metropolitan", "region", "klmr", "beyond", "recognit", "kl", "one", "exampl", "among", "mani", "intens", "southeast", "asian", "properti", "led", "urban", "develop", "fuell", "demograph", "pressur", "global", "capit", "inflow", "transform", "region", "natur", "built", "environ", "purpos", "studi", "investig", "influenc", "globalis", "neoliber", "properti", "led", "develop", "built", "form", "socio", "cultur", "legaci", "klmr", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "major", "aim", "studi", "determin", "neoliber", "properti", "led", "develop", "impact", "urban", "form", "structur", "klmr", "methodolog", "appli", "studi", "concentr", "main", "use", "qualit", "research", "method", "major", "qualit", "research", "method", "includ", "qualit", "analysi", "field", "survey", "observ", "primari", "secondari", "data", "collect", "approach", "studi", "exemplifi", "shift", "govern", "sponsor", "develop", "post", "independ", "period", "current", "globalis", "privat", "orient", "develop", "find", "major", "find", "research", "suggest", "global", "properti", "led", "mode", "urban", "develop", "whilst", "superfici", "success", "undermin", "tradit", "tropic", "climat", "urban", "landscap", "also", "bequeath", "mani", "urban", "properti", "level", "problem", "includ", "traffic", "congest", "air", "pollut", "plan", "govern", "build", "manag", "issu", "paper", "outlin", "narrat", "balanc", "sustain", "mode", "urban", "develop", "tune", "local", "cultur", "climat", "condit", "origin", "valu", "paper", "provid", "deep", "insight", "analysi", "evalu", "kl", "growth", "small", "town", "global", "metropolitan", "region", "properti", "led", "develop", "dictat", "rule", "determin", "charact", "citi"]}, "996eaea1-ac5a-48ed-b6ca-370de9a1bd28": {"title": "Measuring the impact of corporate governance on non-financial reporting in the top HEIs worldwide", "author_name": "Mahalaxmi Adhikari Parajuli, Mehul Chhatbar, Abeer Hassan", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/measuring-the-impact-of-corporate-governance-on-non-financial-rep", "date": "12 May 2022", "data_desc": "Purpose \u2013 This study aims to measure the relationship between corporate governance and Non-Financial Reporting (NFR) in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).

We used the EU NFR Directive (2014/95/EU) to measure NFR. This includes environmental, corporate social responsibility, human rights, corporate board effectiveness, and corruption and bribery. Cross sectional data was collected form 89 HEIs worldwide across 15 different countries over three years.

Our findings reveal that the audit quality, VC pay, and VC gender are significantly and positively associated with NFR content disclosure. However, board effectiveness has a significant negative impact on NFR content disclosure. More interestingly, our findings reveal that student engagement has an insignificant association with NFR content disclosure and there significant difference on the level of NFR content disclosure across universities situated in different geographical region such as USA, Australia, UK, and EU, Asia & Canada. Our findings have important implications for regulators and policymakers.

The authors use a systematic literature review following the recommendations of Bowen (2009) to identify critical challenges financing PPP projects using SRI Sukuk. In the next phase, the authors interview participants involved in an SRI Sukuk financed PPP project to get more significant insights on the challenges identified through the literature review process. Findings: The authors identify the need for greater transparency for SRI financed PPP projects. Also, organisational and legislative challenges are limiting the attractiveness of SRI Sukuk as a financing mechanisms for post-COVID development projects. Practical implications: SRI Sukuk is an emerging financing concept, and the use of such an Islamic financial instrument in financing development projects can serve as a viable alternative for policymakers in a post-COVID economic environment. Social implications: The successful completion of the development projects integrating the concept of Social Maslahah through SRI Sukuk in Malaysia could encourage other emerging economies to use such innovative Islamic financial instrument for economic development in post-COVID environment.

In this model, trade is driven, not by comparative advantages, but by strategic considerations. We prove, in a Ricardianframework, the simultaneous existence of two types of equilibria, at both of which active international trade takes place. In the first type of equilibrium, both countries specialise based on comparative advantages. In the other, each country produces only its comparative-disadvantage good. The welfare properties, and policy implications of this result (using the examples of the China\u2013US trade war and Venezuela), are discussed at length in two dedicated sections. We show that the predictions of the RTCA depend, not on the number of agents in the economy, but on the nature of agents: the RTCA fails to obtain even with an infinite number of large players in each country.

This study is based on a large survey undertaken at a UK Business School at the beginning of course induction meetings for 1st year undergraduate students. The results reveal that there is a significant misalignment between students' university feedback expectations and actual university feedback.

Notwithstanding vested interests and the unrecognised paradox of adopting environmental business strategies, the implementation of sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is imperative to catalyse economic transition away from fossil-fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones.  The research proceeded sequentially.  First, it scanned the backdrop to the SAR problem and identified key associated institutions and a corpus of recent literature.  An initial review to disentangle its conflicting threads generated three themes of \u2018climate crisis\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 or more \u2018radical\u2019 SAR reform paradigms.  Iteratively harnessing this thematic lens, the investigation re-examined the SAR literature corpus.  It detected fragmented SAR responses to the climate crisis.  Accordingly, the research reformulated its first theme to \u2018dystopic climate crisis fragmentation\u2019 but only refined the other two conservative or radical themes to take account of materiality and the split between Anglo-Saxon (IFRS, SSAB) or global and continental institutions (UN, EU, GRI).  Conservatives defend incremental standard improvements but retain a single materiality investor-focus.  Radicals seek to implement double materiality with a broader spectrum of stakeholders in mind.  Both approaches have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages, so the SAR contention rumbles on.

This is further strengthened by our finding that the positive effect of executive ownership on dividend tunneling is more pronounced for firms with weaker minority shareholder protection. In addition, our results show that higher degrees of state ownership may further intensify this positive association. Finally, we find that analyst coverage has a moderating effect and constrains the collusion between controlling shareholders and executives in dividend tunneling activity.Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsOur study contributes to the literature on the role of managerial ownership in controlling shareholders' dividend tunneling activity. We fill a gap in the literature on the corporate agency problem by providing evidence that dividends have been employed by controlling shareholders as a means of tunneling and that executives with higher ownership are more likely to collude with controlling shareholders in dividend tunneling activities.Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsThis study contributes to the debates around the promotion of the cash dividend policy in China, as our findings show that cash dividends are used as a tunneling vehicle.

First, inbound tourism in Singapore not only contributes directly to GDP, employment, and the current account via tourism revenues but also by stimulating exports it improves further the current account of Singapore. Secondly, the stimulation of exports induced by inbound tourism creates favorable sustainability conditions for the entire tourism sector. However, one should be cautious that this effect is taking more than 9 months to materialize and that inbound tourism may initially have a negative impact effect on Singapore\u2019s exports as the overtime effect of tourism on exports exhibits a J-curve behavior.", "filtered_title": ["tourism", "export", "case", "singapor", "nichola", "tsouni", "georg", "agiomirgianaki", "dimitri", "sereni", "antonio", "adamopoulo", "articl", "examin", "relationship", "inbound", "tourism", "export", "singapor", "address", "whether", "long", "run", "relationship", "export", "tourism", "direct", "causal", "two", "variabl", "find", "suggest", "long", "run", "relat", "singapor", "export", "inbound", "tourism", "causat", "bidirect", "impli", "inbound", "tourism", "singapor", "result", "higher", "demand", "domest", "product", "increas", "demand", "singaporean", "product", "turn", "act", "posit", "advertis", "campaign", "favor", "singapor", "promot", "inbound", "tourism", "countri", "polici", "implic", "find", "twofold", "first", "inbound", "tourism", "singapor", "contribut", "direct", "gdp", "employ", "current", "account", "via", "tourism", "revenu", "also", "stimul", "export", "improv", "current", "account", "singapor", "second", "stimul", "export", "induc", "inbound", "tourism", "creat", "favor", "sustain", "condit", "entir", "tourism", "sector", "howev", "one", "cautious", "effect", "take", "9", "month", "materi", "inbound", "tourism", "may", "initi", "negat", "impact", "effect", "singapor", "export", "overtim", "effect", "tourism", "export", "exhibit", "j", "curv", "behavior"]}, "5ba8b7a7-5244-48f1-ad9b-d7a8084ccd30": {"title": "Unveiling the black swan of the finance\u2010growth Nexus: Assumptions and preliminary evidence of virtuous and unvirtuous cycles", "author_name": "Eliana Lauretta, Sajid M.

However, governments in these countries have been reluctant to relinquish the pre-existing controls on economy and have adopted nuanced and sophisticated approaches to retain control. In such context, scholars may find it challenging to investigate the role played by the state in the success or failure of attempted market reforms. This work investigates the different forms of state-induced accounting controls that may preserve the status quo within the economy during transition, using Myanmar as an example. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a longitudinal qualitative research method aiming to reveal the very processes and mechanisms used by the banks and their evolution over time. This method is in accordance with the historical institutionalist perspective that they have applied within this research. Findings: The authors found that the Myanmar government embarked on the privatisation of their financial sector from 1990 to 2016 as a major public sector reform initiative. Under the guise of market reforms, it used both state-led and market-led controls to emulate and retain the socialist banking model where banks are used to fund the immediate government's budget deficits. This created a series of intended and unintended consequences, resulting in the ultimate failure of the government's market reforms. Research limitations/implications: Previously, research on public sector management accounting in emerging economies was not relying consistently on using theory. The relative limited theorisation led to gaps when attempting to understand and explain the opaque forms of state control mechanisms in transition economies. By applying historical institutionalist perspective, and a more theory-driven, reflective approach to the interpretation of the data collected, the authors have provided a deeper insight and understanding on how different forms of state controls can emerge, adapt and persist in transition economies such as Myanmar. Practical implications: The authors demonstrated that though the state may have implemented market reforms to signal regimes change, this does not necessarily mean that the government has relinquished their control on the economy. The state could take a more sophisticated, covert approach towards state controls leading to both intended and unintended consequences. Thus, even if the state's preferences change, the decisions cannot be easily reversed, as path-dependent state controls may have become pervasive affecting any further institutional and policy developments. Thus, the authors suggest that governments in both transition and developed economies should be cautious when enacting regulations on corporate control. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors have applied a historical institutional perspective in their analysis instead of the more widely used sociological, institutionalist approach. This allowed authors to harness rich longitudinal data indicating that market reforms and their success or failure should be examined as an ongoing process rather than a completed action. This is especially important in transition economies where the state may be unwilling to renounce the existing controls on the industry and may resort to more opaque forms of state control, eventually obstructing the intended reforms.", "filtered_title": ["histor", "institutionalist", "perspect", "persist", "state", "control", "financi", "sector", "reform", "insight", "case", "myanmar", "sandar", "win", "alexand", "kofina", "purpos", "mani", "transit", "economi", "former", "socialist", "plan", "economi", "undergon", "market", "reform", "financi", "sector", "signal", "transit", "toward", "democraci", "howev", "govern", "countri", "reluct", "relinquish", "pre", "exist", "control", "economi", "adopt", "nuanc", "sophist", "approach", "retain", "control", "context", "scholar", "may", "find", "challeng", "investig", "role", "play", "state", "success", "failur", "attempt", "market", "reform", "work", "investig", "differ", "form", "state", "induc", "account", "control", "may", "preserv", "status", "quo", "within", "economi", "transit", "use", "myanmar", "exampl", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "author", "adopt", "longitudin", "qualit", "research", "method", "aim", "reveal", "process", "mechan", "use", "bank", "evolut", "time", "method", "accord", "histor", "institutionalist", "perspect", "appli", "within", "research", "find", "author", "found", "myanmar", "govern", "embark", "privatis", "financi", "sector", "1990", "2016", "major", "public", "sector", "reform", "initi", "guis", "market", "reform", "use", "state", "led", "market", "led", "control", "emul", "retain", "socialist", "bank", "model", "bank", "use", "fund", "immedi", "govern", "budget", "deficit", "creat", "seri", "intend", "unintend", "consequ", "result", "ultim", "failur", "govern", "market", "reform", "research", "limit", "implic", "previous", "research", "public", "sector", "manag", "account", "emerg", "economi", "reli", "consist", "use", "theori", "relat", "limit", "theoris", "led", "gap", "attempt", "understand", "explain", "opaqu", "form", "state", "control", "mechan", "transit", "economi", "appli", "histor", "institutionalist", "perspect", "theori", "driven", "reflect", "approach", "interpret", "data", "collect", "author", "provid", "deeper", "insight", "understand", "differ", "form", "state", "control", "emerg", "adapt", "persist", "transit", "economi", "myanmar", "practic", "implic", "author", "demonstr", "though", "state", "may", "implement", "market", "reform", "signal", "regim", "chang", "necessarili", "mean", "govern", "relinquish", "control", "economi", "state", "could", "take", "sophist", "covert", "approach", "toward", "state", "control", "lead", "intend", "unintend", "consequ", "thus", "even", "state", "prefer", "chang", "decis", "easili", "revers", "path", "depend", "state", "control", "may", "becom", "pervas", "affect", "institut", "polici", "develop", "thus", "author", "suggest", "govern", "transit", "develop", "economi", "cautious", "enact", "regul", "corpor", "control", "origin", "valu", "paper", "author", "appli", "histor", "institut", "perspect", "analysi", "instead", "wide", "use", "sociolog", "institutionalist", "approach", "allow", "author", "har", "rich", "longitudin", "data", "indic", "market", "reform", "success", "failur", "examin", "ongo", "process", "rather", "complet", "action", "especi", "import", "transit", "economi", "state", "may", "unwil", "renounc", "exist", "control", "industri", "may", "resort", "opaqu", "form", "state", "control", "eventu", "obstruct", "intend", "reform"]}, "f63084a6-65e5-4b27-8b06-52361fb46784": {"title": "An appraisal of Turkey's voluntary individual pension system from a perspective of pension equality", "author_name": "Sertac Babat, Derya Gultekin Karakas, Mehtap Hisarciklilar", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/an-appraisal-of-turkeys-voluntary-individual-pension-system-from-", "date": "Sep 2021", "data_desc": "Since 2003, Turkey\u2019s pension policy has been increasingly based on facilitation of individual savings administered by private pension funds.

This paper analyzes how bank capital, credit and liquidity requirements impact bank solvency, using ten major banks controlling 90% of the UK market share in 2009-2018. The GMM model indicates a strong association between credit and liquidity risks. That is, when banks finance a risky or distressed project, this will lead to an increase in nonperforming loans (NPL), which reduces bank liquidity. Poor liquidity profile of a bank may restrict its ability to act as a financial intermediary. In addition, the findings indicate that efficiency, asset quality, and economic growth have a significant positive effect on the solvency of banks. The results also show that the regulatory capital (Tier1) has a positive significant influence on bank solvency. Further, the results indicate that during the economic boom, banks tend to increase their regulatory capital. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that during the \"good time\", banks can accumulate enough capital that is genuinely capable of absorbing negative shock. Also, it is important for banks to ensure that they are efficient but also have a robust credit appraisal system to reduce NPL. This paper also demonstrates the implications of increased capital requirements. That is, increased capital requirements ensure not only banks are liquid but also solvent, which allows them to provide financial intermediation.", "filtered_title": ["bank", "solvenc", "role", "credit", "liquid", "risk", "regulatori", "capit", "econom", "stabil", "isaiah", "oino", "bank", "stabil", "essenti", "economi", "due", "mani", "function", "includ", "intermedi", "payment", "facilit", "credit", "creation", "thus", "stabil", "bank", "industri", "one", "critic", "ingredi", "econom", "growth", "paper", "analyz", "bank", "capit", "credit", "liquid", "requir", "impact", "bank", "solvenc", "use", "ten", "major", "bank", "control", "90", "uk", "market", "share", "2009", "2018", "gmm", "model", "indic", "strong", "associ", "credit", "liquid", "risk", "bank", "financ", "riski", "distress", "project", "lead", "increas", "nonperform", "loan", "npl", "reduc", "bank", "liquid", "poor", "liquid", "profil", "bank", "may", "restrict", "abil", "act", "financi", "intermediari", "addit", "find", "indic", "effici", "asset", "qualiti", "econom", "growth", "signific", "posit", "effect", "solvenc", "bank", "result", "also", "show", "regulatori", "capit", "tier1", "posit", "signific", "influenc", "bank", "solvenc", "result", "indic", "econom", "boom", "bank", "tend", "increas", "regulatori", "capit", "therefor", "need", "ensur", "good", "time", "bank", "accumul", "enough", "capit", "genuin", "capabl", "absorb", "negat", "shock", "also", "import", "bank", "ensur", "effici", "also", "robust", "credit", "apprais", "system", "reduc", "npl", "paper", "also", "demonstr", "implic", "increas", "capit", "requir", "increas", "capit", "requir", "ensur", "bank", "liquid", "also", "solvent", "allow", "provid", "financi", "intermedi"]}, "d22be3ae-e970-4a77-a8d8-807e38f7529a": {"title": "Can Citizen Science Increase Trust in Research ?

We evaluate the quality of corporate and government mercury reporting via the Australian National Pollutant Inventory (NPI), which underpins Australia's reporting under the Minamata Convention, a global agreement to reduce mercury pollution. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative characteristics of accounting information are used as a theoretical frame to analyse ten interviews with thirteen interviewees as well as 54 submissions to the 2018 governmental enquiry into the NPI. Findings: While Australian mercury accounting using the NPI is likely sufficient to meet the expected Minamata reporting requirements (especially in comparison to developing countries), we find significant limitations in relation to comparability, accuracy, timeliness and completeness. These limitations primarily relate to government (as opposed to industry) deficiencies, caused by insufficient funding. The findings suggest that multiple factors are required to realise the potential of pollutant databases for corporate accountability, including appropriate rules, ideological commitment and resourcing Practical implications: The provision of additional funding would enable the NPI to be considerably improved (for mercury as well as other pollutants), particularly in relation to the measurement and reporting of emissions from diffuse sources. Originality/value: Whilst there have been prior reviews of the NPI, none have focused on mercury, whilst conversely prior studies which have discussed mercury information have not focused on the NPI. In addition, no prior NPI studies have utilised interviews nor have engaged directly with NPI regulators.

This study also explores whether the NLSP-SDGR nexus is contingent on the environmental sensitivity of oil industries in Libya. We employ a quantitative content analysis based on word counts to determine the level of SDGR among a cross- sectional sample of 524 observations of the major Libyan oil companies in the 2015/2016 fiscal year. Using measures derived from the World Development Indicators (WDI), a cross-sectional regression analysis has been employed to investigate how NLSP explains variations in SDGR noted in 2015/2016. Descriptive evidence in- dicates that Libyan oil companies tend to report SDG information on their websites about Good Health and Well- being (SDG3), Quality Education (SDG4), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12). Our regression results suggest that the NLSP positively and significantly influences corporate commitment to the SDGR agenda among a sample of the major oil com- panies in Libya. Additionally, the environmental sensitivity of oil industries appeared to be moderating the NLSP- SDGR nexus.

The authors relied on unique governance variables extracted from the Bloomberg database to develop the governance deviance index. Findings: Study unveils that deviance from governance practices influences firm\u2019s performance.

This study is focused on the US financial market, but in future, researchers could revalidate the deviance index. Scholars can also use mixed methods to test the need for innovative governance mechanisms in emerging markets. Practical implications: The firms should focus on innovative governance practices not only to safeguard the firm\u2019s entrepreneurial identity but also to pursue the growth objectives. Such innovative mechanisms and managerial controls are helpful to deal with industrial transformations to satisfy key stakeholders.

Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on capture theory to bring out the factors that have rendered redundant the state intervention to make corporations accountable for their environmental activities. The research setting is the oil and gas and cement industry in Nigeria. Data for the study are derived from both documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and analysed using a thematic technique. Findings: The findings of the paper demonstrate a regulatory failure to hold corporations to account for their environmental activities. A lack of political will, outdated regulations and the manipulation of the regulators, all have played a part in preventing corporations from being accountable for their activities. In addition, the widespread elite corruption in the country has provided corporations with leeway to manipulate their environmental accountability practices. The study emphasises the need for continuous review of the regulations and efforts to reduce corruption in order to promote corporations' environmental accountability in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to Nigeria, oil and gas and cement industries. The theoretical lens can be used to address problem of capture of the regulations and institution in the country. Practical implications: The practical implication is that it would enhance environmental regulations in Nigeria and emerging economies. It will also provide support from researchers emerging markets on the adoption of capture theory in future research. Social implications: It will promote corporate best environmental practices in the country. It will reduce the issues surrounding environmental accountability practices and create awareness on environmental issues among the populace. It will create the impression that corporations will be held accountable for their environmental activities in the country and the need to have improved environmental regulations in the country. Originality/value: The study adds to the debate on corporate environmental accountability practices engendering insights from the Nigerian oil and gas and cement industry.

Pre-conditions included the illegitimacy of the colonial regime, repression that polarised nationalist sentiment.

The role of the epistemic community in selectively ignoring the positive aspects of local accounting practice is a significant impediment. In this way, members of this epistemic community continue to execute their \u2018relational power\u2019 generated through professional knowledge, expertise and elite connections over the local actors, hence upholding the generalised assumptive logics. The paper argues that public accountability and transparency can be strengthened in SSA countries provided there is an \u2018intelligent\u2019 application of existing regulations and accounting systems, rather than seeking to merely replace them with externally imposed large-scale GARs.", "filtered_title": ["govern", "account", "reform", "sub", "saharan", "african", "countri", "select", "ignor", "epistem", "communiti", "compet", "logic", "perspect", "kelum", "nishanta", "jayasingh", "jayasingh", "andi", "wynn", "pawan", "adhikari", "teerooven", "soobaroyen", "john", "malagila", "abdurafiu", "noah", "object", "paper", "two", "fold", "first", "assess", "exist", "local", "account", "financi", "report", "practic", "sub", "saharan", "africa", "ssa", "focus", "extent", "recent", "govern", "financi", "statement", "publish", "ten", "select", "countri", "adher", "mainstream", "qualit", "featur", "public", "sector", "report", "second", "investig", "multipl", "institut", "logic", "play", "context", "govern", "account", "reform", "gar", "ssa", "involv", "intern", "organis", "epistem", "communiti", "member", "polici", "maker", "local", "actor", "data", "studi", "drawn", "content", "analysi", "disclosur", "score", "ten", "ssa", "govern", "financi", "statement", "supplement", "forti", "semi", "structur", "interview", "carri", "nigeria", "tanzania", "find", "demonstr", "generalis", "assumpt", "logic", "intern", "organis", "coupl", "market", "profession", "logic", "epistem", "communiti", "member", "state", "logic", "local", "politician", "led", "marginalis", "good", "exist", "account", "financi", "report", "practic", "ssa", "reflect", "extent", "govern", "financi", "statement", "adher", "mainstream", "featur", "public", "sector", "report", "provid", "countri", "strong", "impetus", "undertak", "transit", "toward", "larg", "scale", "gar", "involv", "accrual", "account", "ipsass", "role", "epistem", "communiti", "select", "ignor", "posit", "aspect", "local", "account", "practic", "signific", "impedi", "way", "member", "epistem", "communiti", "continu", "execut", "relat", "power", "generat", "profession", "knowledg", "expertis", "elit", "connect", "local", "actor", "henc", "uphold", "generalis", "assumpt", "logic", "paper", "argu", "public", "account", "transpar", "strengthen", "ssa", "countri", "provid", "intellig", "applic", "exist", "regul", "account", "system", "rather", "seek", "mere", "replac", "extern", "impos", "larg", "scale", "gar"]}, "44b5664d-200b-42a9-a277-26e9fff3025c": {"title": "Growth Effects of Remittance: A Case of Turkey Diaspora", "author_name": "Caterina De Lucia, Luigi Pio Leonardo Cavaliere, Ester Salvato, Alessio Faccia", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/growth-effects-of-remittance-a-case-of-turkey-diaspora", "date": "12 Feb 2021", "data_desc": "In the age of globalization, remittances are an essential part of human life.

The paper then confirmed the analyses by comparing the last 5 years\u2019 performances (measured by the ROE ratio and Deposits Growth as Inputs, and Assets Growth as an Output) of the Italian Online Banking industry (average of the years 2016-2019). The data are retrieved from the Italian Public Registry of Incorporated Companies (managed by the Italian Chambers of Commerce) and processed using the DEA SOLVER software. This article strategically enhanced the knowledge of a previous one focused on the same bank by providing different perspectives and, therefore, a comprehensive view of the Widiba bank case study. It, therefore, aims at producing useful resources for business schools, practitioners, and experts.", "filtered_title": ["onlin", "bank", "itali", "widiba", "bank", "case", "studi", "pestl", "dea", "analysi", "alessio", "faccia", "luigi", "pio", "leonardo", "cavalier", "given", "great", "interest", "impact", "generat", "previous", "articl", "widiba", "bank", "case", "studi", "publish", "journal", "author", "intend", "provid", "insight", "analysi", "current", "italian", "framework", "pestl", "analysi", "therefor", "carri", "identifi", "main", "financi", "environment", "altern", "strategi", "object", "research", "chosen", "compani", "widiba", "bank", "despit", "latecom", "italian", "onlin", "bank", "industri", "success", "demonstr", "import", "adopt", "target", "strategi", "digit", "world", "perform", "analysi", "pestl", "allow", "provid", "mani", "insight", "differ", "perspect", "paper", "confirm", "analys", "compar", "last", "5", "year", "perform", "measur", "roe", "ratio", "deposit", "growth", "input", "asset", "growth", "output", "italian", "onlin", "bank", "industri", "averag", "year", "2016", "2019", "data", "retriev", "italian", "public", "registri", "incorpor", "compani", "manag", "italian", "chamber", "commerc", "process", "use", "dea", "solver", "softwar", "articl", "strateg", "enhanc", "knowledg", "previous", "one", "focus", "bank", "provid", "differ", "perspect", "therefor", "comprehens", "view", "widiba", "bank", "case", "studi", "therefor", "aim", "produc", "use", "resourc", "busi", "school", "practition", "expert"]}, "70c6b7d7-0ad4-4351-a927-2df252349c6d": {"title": "Performance measurement in smart city governance: A case study of an Egyptian city council", "author_name": "Loai Alsaid", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/performance-measurement-in-smart-city-governance-a-case-study-of-", "date": "2021", "data_desc": "Purpose: This study seeks to explore the powerful role(s) of institutionalised performance measurement systems or metrics in smart city governance in a politically and militarily sensitive developing country. Design/methodology/approach: This study extends the application and contribution of a multi-level institutional framework to previous management accounting literature on the potential relationship between performance measurement and smart city governance. The value of utilising a multi-level framework is to broaden and deepen theoretical analyses about this relationship to include the effect of political pressure from the military regime at the macro level on the institutionalisation of a performance measurement system at the micro-organisational level. Taking the New Cairo city council smart electricity networks project (Egypt) as an interpretive qualitative single-case study, data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, direct observations and documentary readings. Findings: Performance measurement systems or metrics, especially in politically and militarily sensitive smart cities, constitutes a process of cascading (macro-micro) institutionalisation that is closely linked to sustainable developments taking place in the wider arena of urban policies. Going a step further, accounting-based performance metrics, arising from political and military pressures towards public-private collaborations, contribute to smart city management and accountability (governance). Institutionalised measurement systems or performance metrics play a powerful accounting role(s) in shaping and reshaping political decisions and military actions in the city council. Originality/value: Theoretically, this study goes beyond the cascading institutionalisation process by arguing for the powerful role(s) of institutionalised accounting and performance measurement systems in smart city decision-making and governance. Empirically, it enriches previous literature with a case study of a developing Arab Spring country, characterised by an emerging economy, political sensitivity and military engagement, rather than developed and more stable countries that have been thoroughly investigated. It is also among the first politically engaged accounting case studies to highlight public-private collaborations as a recent reform in public sector governance and accountability.", "filtered_title": ["perform", "measur", "smart", "citi", "govern", "case", "studi", "egyptian", "citi", "council", "loai", "alsaid", "purpos", "studi", "seek", "explor", "power", "role", "institutionalis", "perform", "measur", "system", "metric", "smart", "citi", "govern", "polit", "militarili", "sensit", "develop", "countri", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "studi", "extend", "applic", "contribut", "multi", "level", "institut", "framework", "previous", "manag", "account", "literatur", "potenti", "relationship", "perform", "measur", "smart", "citi", "govern", "valu", "utilis", "multi", "level", "framework", "broaden", "deepen", "theoret", "analys", "relationship", "includ", "effect", "polit", "pressur", "militari", "regim", "macro", "level", "institutionalis", "perform", "measur", "system", "micro", "organis", "level", "take", "new", "cairo", "citi", "council", "smart", "electr", "network", "project", "egypt", "interpret", "qualit", "singl", "case", "studi", "data", "collect", "method", "includ", "semi", "structur", "interview", "direct", "observ", "documentari", "read", "find", "perform", "measur", "system", "metric", "especi", "polit", "militarili", "sensit", "smart", "citi", "constitut", "process", "cascad", "macro", "micro", "institutionalis", "close", "link", "sustain", "develop", "take", "place", "wider", "arena", "urban", "polici", "go", "step", "account", "base", "perform", "metric", "aris", "polit", "militari", "pressur", "toward", "public", "privat", "collabor", "contribut", "smart", "citi", "manag", "account", "govern", "institutionalis", "measur", "system", "perform", "metric", "play", "power", "account", "role", "shape", "reshap", "polit", "decis", "militari", "action", "citi", "council", "origin", "valu", "theoret", "studi", "goe", "beyond", "cascad", "institutionalis", "process", "argu", "power", "role", "institutionalis", "account", "perform", "measur", "system", "smart", "citi", "decis", "make", "govern", "empir", "enrich", "previous", "literatur", "case", "studi", "develop", "arab", "spring", "countri", "characteris", "emerg", "economi", "polit", "sensit", "militari", "engag", "rather", "develop", "stabl", "countri", "thorough", "investig", "also", "among", "first", "polit", "engag", "account", "case", "studi", "highlight", "public", "privat", "collabor", "recent", "reform", "public", "sector", "govern", "account"]}, "a1d96ff2-d18c-43e7-b36f-85d50b58e735": {"title": "Probability of Mergers and Acquisitions Deal Failure", "author_name": "Sailesh Tanna, Ibrahim Yousef, Mathias Nnadi", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/probability-of-mergers-and-acquisitions-deal-failure", "date": "21 Jan 2021", "data_desc": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the probability of deal success/failure in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) transactions is influenced by a range of deal, firm and country-specific characteristics which tend to affect acquirers\u2019 shareholder returns. The specific hypotheses under investigation relate to the method of payment (cash versus stock), target status (listed versus non-listed), diversification (domestic versus cross-border and industry-wide) and acquirers\u2019 prior bidding experience. Additionally, the authors also investigate whether announced deals reflect an expectation about likelihood of deal completion. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyse the probability of deal success/failure in M&As by combining event study and probit regression-based methods. The authors use the standard event study methodology to calculate acquirers\u2019 abnormal returns for up to 10 days before and after the announcement date. In the probit model, the dependent variable is the probability of deal i being failure depending on four sets of explanatory variables: method of payment, target status, diversification and acquirer bidding experience, along with a set of control variables. Findings: The findings from event study confirm that market reaction is indifferent to whether announced deals are likely to be successfully completed or not, consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis. However, the results from cross-sectional, cross-country regressions confirm that the aforementioned deal characteristics, as well as certain firm and country level attributes do influence the likelihood of whether an announced deal is subsequently completed or terminated. Originality/value: In examining whether the specific characteristics affecting the likelihood that M&A transactions, once announced, will ultimately succeed or fail, it seems natural to ask whether the market reaction at the time of deal announcement reflects an expectation regarding deal completion. This could be associated with specific deal or firm-level characteristics influencing shareholder returns or risk, and represents a unique contribution of this study, over and above the use of a global sample of M&A data.

Also, the findings indicate that higher capital requirements for banks significantly positively influence liquidity. Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between growth in loans and total regulatory capital. The results imply banks should ensure that the quality of the capital base and the buffers above the regulatory minimum are built up during periods of strong earnings growth.

This study aims to investigate the impact of stakeholder power on the management decisions at the BBC following the release of its 2017 gender pay gap report.To achieve this objectives, we adopt the qualitative approach, obtaining data (tweets) from social media. This approach enabled us to provide an in-depth understanding of the broken trust as well as the proximity and connectedness of BBC stakeholders who, if not employees, are incidentally TV licence fee payers. This approach also enables an understanding of stakeholder reaction following trust damage actions taken by the BBC. We further analysed the information generated from the tweets thematically which was underpinned by the stakeholders\u2019 theory. We contribute to the body of knowledge with the following key results: (1) stakeholder proximity to gender pay differentials at the BBC was stronger and wider because of their triadic relationship with the corporation e.g. employee, British household and British public.

Moreover, the authors used multinomial logistic regressions to extend the results where the dependent variable is a nominal variable equal to (1) for non-payment of dividends, (2) for lower dividend payments, and (3) for higher dividend payments.Findings \u2013 The authors report a finding consistent with the life-cycle theory of dividends where a higher proportion of retained-earnings-to-contributionmix implies a greater likelihood of dividend payments, apart from conventional characteristics such as profitability, size and growth. However, the authors find marked differences in the magnitude and significance of the life-cycle characteristics explaining the likelihood of dividend payouts for Islamic and conventional banks. The authors also find that Islamic banks are smaller and less profitable relative to conventional banks but have higher growth rates, which helps to explain why the proportion of dividend non-payments is higher for Islamic banks than for conventional banks. The results also indicate that the higher default rates and business risk associated with GCC banks reduces their propensity to pay dividends.Practical implications \u2013 The topic of dividends remains an important puzzle in the field of modern finance. The findings have significant implications for a variety of stakeholders in both Islamic and conventional banks in GCC countries, including investors, depositors, analysts, managers, regulators and stock exchanges.Originality/value \u2013 This paper aims to contribute to the literature by drawing on life-cycle theory as a basis for comparing the determinants affecting the likelihood of dividend payouts by Islamic and conventional banks in the GCC countries.", "filtered_title": ["test", "dividend", "life", "cycl", "theori", "islam", "convent", "bank", "sector", "gcc", "countri", "ibrahim", "yousef", "sailesh", "tanna", "sudip", "patra", "purpos", "paper", "aim", "present", "compar", "evalu", "determin", "affect", "likelihood", "dividend", "payout", "islam", "convent", "bank", "gulf", "cooper", "council", "gcc", "countri", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "author", "use", "dynam", "panel", "logit", "model", "test", "dividend", "lifecycletheori", "analyz", "determin", "affect", "likelihood", "dividend", "payout", "gcc", "bank", "moreov", "author", "use", "multinomi", "logist", "regress", "extend", "result", "depend", "variabl", "nomin", "variabl", "equal", "1", "non", "payment", "dividend", "2", "lower", "dividend", "payment", "3", "higher", "dividend", "payment", "find", "author", "report", "find", "consist", "life", "cycl", "theori", "dividend", "higher", "proport", "retain", "earn", "contributionmix", "impli", "greater", "likelihood", "dividend", "payment", "apart", "convent", "characterist", "profit", "size", "growth", "howev", "author", "find", "mark", "differ", "magnitud", "signific", "life", "cycl", "characterist", "explain", "likelihood", "dividend", "payout", "islam", "convent", "bank", "author", "also", "find", "islam", "bank", "smaller", "less", "profit", "relat", "convent", "bank", "higher", "growth", "rate", "help", "explain", "proport", "dividend", "non", "payment", "higher", "islam", "bank", "convent", "bank", "result", "also", "indic", "higher", "default", "rate", "busi", "risk", "associ", "gcc", "bank", "reduc", "propens", "pay", "dividend", "practic", "implic", "topic", "dividend", "remain", "import", "puzzl", "field", "modern", "financ", "find", "signific", "implic", "varieti", "stakehold", "islam", "convent", "bank", "gcc", "countri", "includ", "investor", "depositor", "analyst", "manag", "regul", "stock", "exchang", "origin", "valu", "paper", "aim", "contribut", "literatur", "draw", "life", "cycl", "theori", "basi", "compar", "determin", "affect", "likelihood", "dividend", "payout", "islam", "convent", "bank", "gcc", "countri"]}, "3baa5b80-0e5c-4122-9e0e-70de2d077d10": {"title": "The effect of institutions on the FDI-growth nexus: What matter most?", "author_name": "Chengchun Li, Sailesh Tanna, Baseerit Nissah", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effect-of-institutions-on-the-fdi-growth-nexus-what-matter-mo", "date": "28 Sep 2021", "data_desc": "This paper examines the extent to which host-country institutions influence the relationship between inward foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth.

It answers the research question: how accounting-based key performance indicators (KPIs) were chosen within a privatised SE to maintain co-existence between two different institutional logics, the social and commercial logics, to gain legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Design/methodology/approach: This study expands the application and contribution of the Besharov and Smith\u2019s (2014) logics multiplicity framework to previous management accounting literature on PMS and institutional logics. It adds a new dimension to previous literature to theorise the cognitive dynamics of institutional logics at three distinct but interrelated institutional levels, namely, field, organisational and individual. Data come from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SE, involved in implementing a social project (drinking water refining) in rural communities. Findings: PMS acts as a political tool through which the privatised case company has gained societal acceptance and legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Its non-political KPIs have turned into political tools to meet the institutional demands of the funding scheme. This government involvement represents field-level institutional logics, which influenced the organisational-level interplay of commercial and social logics and then the individual-level choice of internal KPIs. This contributes to the fact that institutional logics and their interplay between these three levels are \u201cin a state of flux\u201d within SEs\u2019 internal PMS. Originality/value: This study deals with a real-life practical case that proves the prevalence of one institutional logic over another at both the organisational and individual levels may be occasioned by organisational field pressures and opportunities rather than by other intra-organisational conflicts as discussed in most previous literature on PMS and institutional logics.", "filtered_title": ["influenc", "institut", "pressur", "implement", "perform", "measur", "system", "egyptian", "social", "enterpris", "loai", "alsaid", "charl", "ambilichu", "purpos", "studi", "aim", "explor", "influenc", "field", "level", "fund", "pressur", "resourc", "depend", "conflict", "institut", "logic", "implement", "new", "perform", "measur", "system", "pms", "within", "privatis", "social", "enterpris", "se", "develop", "countri", "answer", "research", "question", "account", "base", "key", "perform", "indic", "kpis", "chosen", "within", "privatis", "se", "maintain", "co", "exist", "two", "differ", "institut", "logic", "social", "commerci", "logic", "gain", "legitimaci", "govern", "fund", "scheme", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "studi", "expand", "applic", "contribut", "besharov", "smith", "2014", "logic", "multipl", "framework", "previous", "manag", "account", "literatur", "pms", "institut", "logic", "add", "new", "dimens", "previous", "literatur", "theoris", "cognit", "dynam", "institut", "logic", "three", "distinct", "interrel", "institut", "level", "name", "field", "organis", "individu", "data", "come", "interpret", "case", "studi", "egyptian", "se", "involv", "implement", "social", "project", "drink", "water", "refin", "rural", "communiti", "find", "pms", "act", "polit", "tool", "privatis", "case", "compani", "gain", "societ", "accept", "legitimaci", "govern", "fund", "scheme", "non", "polit", "kpis", "turn", "polit", "tool", "meet", "institut", "demand", "fund", "scheme", "govern", "involv", "repres", "field", "level", "institut", "logic", "influenc", "organis", "level", "interplay", "commerci", "social", "logic", "individu", "level", "choic", "intern", "kpis", "contribut", "fact", "institut", "logic", "interplay", "three", "level", "state", "flux", "within", "ses", "intern", "pms", "origin", "valu", "studi", "deal", "real", "life", "practic", "case", "prove", "preval", "one", "institut", "logic", "anoth", "organis", "individu", "level", "may", "occas", "organis", "field", "pressur", "opportun", "rather", "intra", "organis", "conflict", "discuss", "previous", "literatur", "pms", "institut", "logic"]}, "9f3ced14-23f1-436c-b089-4977e415a29e": {"title": "The predictive strength of MBS yield spreads during asset bubbles", "author_name": "Solomon Deku, Alper Kara, Artur Semeyutin", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-predictive-strength-of-mbs-yield-spreads-during-asset-bubbles", "date": "Jan 2021", "data_desc": "We examine whether the predictive power of initial yield spreads of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) vary with the financial cycle.

Institutional isomorphism produces a greater impact on Libya accounting and auditing practices (Phillips & Jiao, 2016). Therefore, this study examines that the cultural factor systematically and consistently assesses the level of ISA adoption, commitment, and associated harmonisation.

The sector plays a significant role for the national economy due to its contribution to job creation, industrialization and economic growth. However, the sector has been widely criticized because of heavy work conditions and high rates of work accidents. The construction industry generally grows faster than GDP in expansion periods and shrinks more during the crisis years. While these fluctuations make the construction industry more unstable, they also affect its employees more negatively than the general economic course during recessions in construction activities. Workplace health and safety standards do not gain priority in a sectoral structure where small and medium-sized companies, subcontractors and contracting services are predominant. On the contrary, the existing structure negatively affects the work conditions and occupational health and safety in many respects. With the growth of the construction sector, while employment rates increase, the rates of occupational accidents, occupational diseases, permanent incapacity and death also go up. Dissatisfaction of the construction workers with the profession and the low prestige attributed to this line of work lead to high labor turnover rates across the sector. The widespread seasonal work in the construction sector as well as the employment of domestic and foreign migrant workers further lower down the labor standards.To fulfil its role in the development of Turkey sustainably and more importantly, to become a decent work area that values human rights, the construction industry needs to provide a more secure and safer work environment. Given the job and social insecurities and the low education of the workforce in general, the sector becomes trapped in a vicious cycle of low skill-low productivity, failing to initiate a sustainable growth pattern based on high value-added production. The sector will continue to show high sensitivity in the face of crises without raising the current work conditions to certain standards through an institutional restructuring. This study aims to identify problems regarding the existent work standards in the Turkish construction sector and to develop policy recommendations for improvement. To this end, in light of the findings obtained from the literature review, an overall assessment of the construction sector and the work conditions is made based on a descriptive analysis of secondary data at sector and firm levels that cover the post-2000 period. In the analysis, data from the Turkish Republic Presidency Strategy and Budget Directorate, TURKSTAT, CBRT and SGK are used. Policy recommendations for improving the workplace standards are developed to enhance the health, skill and job satisfaction of the workers and to achieve a sustainable growth path in the sector.", "filtered_title": ["t\u00fcrkiy", "i\u0307n\u015faat", "sanayii", "\u00e7al\u0131\u015fma", "standartlar\u0131n\u0131n", "sekt\u00f6rel", "geli\u015fim", "\u00fczerinden", "de\u011ferlendirilmesi", "derya", "g\u00fcltekin", "karaka\u015f", "ferimah", "yusufi", "mehtap", "hisarciklilar", "turkish", "construct", "industri", "achiev", "rapid", "growth", "sinc", "2000s", "sector", "play", "signific", "role", "nation", "economi", "due", "contribut", "job", "creation", "industri", "econom", "growth", "howev", "sector", "wide", "critic", "heavi", "work", "condit", "high", "rate", "work", "accid", "construct", "industri", "general", "grow", "faster", "gdp", "expans", "period", "shrink", "crisi", "year", "fluctuat", "make", "construct", "industri", "unstabl", "also", "affect", "employe", "negat", "general", "econom", "cours", "recess", "construct", "activ", "workplac", "health", "safeti", "standard", "gain", "prioriti", "sector", "structur", "small", "medium", "size", "compani", "subcontractor", "contract", "servic", "predomin", "contrari", "exist", "structur", "negat", "affect", "work", "condit", "occup", "health", "safeti", "mani", "respect", "growth", "construct", "sector", "employ", "rate", "increas", "rate", "occup", "accid", "occup", "diseas", "perman", "incapac", "death", "also", "go", "dissatisfact", "construct", "worker", "profess", "low", "prestig", "attribut", "line", "work", "lead", "high", "labor", "turnov", "rate", "across", "sector", "widespread", "season", "work", "construct", "sector", "well", "employ", "domest", "foreign", "migrant", "worker", "lower", "labor", "standard", "fulfil", "role", "develop", "turkey", "sustain", "import", "becom", "decent", "work", "area", "valu", "human", "right", "construct", "industri", "need", "provid", "secur", "safer", "work", "environ", "given", "job", "social", "insecur", "low", "educ", "workforc", "general", "sector", "becom", "trap", "vicious", "cycl", "low", "skill", "low", "product", "fail", "initi", "sustain", "growth", "pattern", "base", "high", "valu", "ad", "product", "sector", "continu", "show", "high", "sensit", "face", "crise", "without", "rais", "current", "work", "condit", "certain", "standard", "institut", "restructur", "studi", "aim", "identifi", "problem", "regard", "exist", "work", "standard", "turkish", "construct", "sector", "develop", "polici", "recommend", "improv", "end", "light", "find", "obtain", "literatur", "review", "overal", "assess", "construct", "sector", "work", "condit", "made", "base", "descript", "analysi", "secondari", "data", "sector", "firm", "level", "cover", "post", "2000", "period", "analysi", "data", "turkish", "republ", "presid", "strategi", "budget", "director", "turkstat", "cbrt", "sgk", "use", "polici", "recommend", "improv", "workplac", "standard", "develop", "enhanc", "health", "skill", "job", "satisfact", "worker", "achiev", "sustain", "growth", "path", "sector"]}, "bf8f0f40-ba28-4cdc-8f1f-0d7f80f3e0bb": {"title": "Understanding Public Sentiment in Relation to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement", "author_name": "Olubunmi Ajala, Amanze Ejiogu, Adeniyi Lawal", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/understanding-public-sentiment-in-relation-to-the-african-contine", "date": "1 Jul 2021", "data_desc": "This study explores public sentiment in relation to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) by analysing 18,481 tweets mentioning ACFTA over a three-month period.

The French Indochina War (FIW) from 1946-1954 furnishes useful insights with resonance for current infectious, climatic, pollution, economic and security challenges.  Five strategic themes structured an analysis of historical literature.  The reasons for the French failure in 1954 involved fundamental regime illegitimacy, political equivocation, intelligence shortcomings, strategic and operational failures but also the determination, strength and adaptability of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh (VM).  In 1945, France had re-occupied Vietnam to re-assert its global credentials.  Later, Cold War logic and American aid sustained \u201cLa sale guerre\u201d.  However, the conflict merely delayed and bloodied an inevitable post-colonial regime shift.  To maintain American aid flows yet retain French regional influence, the commander of the Expeditionary Corps, Henri Navarre, adopted an offensive stance.  He sought to crush the VM, breathe life into the moribund French Union (L\u2019Union fran\u00e7aise) and block Gi\u00e1p\u2019s feints on Laos.  In November 1954, he inserted a fortified camp at remote Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Ph\u00fa (DBP).  However, Navarre ignored the lessons of H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh (1950-51), Ngh\u0129a L\u1ed9 (1951).  He misread N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n (1952) and underestimated VM capabilities.  Operationally, the distance of DBP from Hanoi stretched the French aero-logistical system to its limits.  Navarre also diverted resources to sideshow \u2013 Op\u00e9ration Atlante.  Gi\u00e1p realised Navarre had taken the bait and sealed off the besieged camp with five divisions, including an artillery one.  On 13th March, the VM attacked and conquered the garrison after 56 days on the evening of 7-8th May 1954.  Navarre\u2019s gamble had spectacularly backfired.  Militarily, the French Expeditionary Corps might have recovered even considering the bloodbath at Mang Yang Pass almost seven weeks later.  However, the psychological blow unmasked regime financial and political bankruptcy.  Power drained away to the Americans or the communists.  Whilst French Indochina perpetuated an iniquitous social structure, tainted by racism, symbolic and physical violence, it arguably it also protected minorities, spurned dictatorship and transferred culture and technology.The most striking finding that emerges from this investigation is the incredible transformation of the geography of Vietnam since 1948.  Then, tigers and elephant roamed in jungles, 160km North West of Saigon, near Phan Thi\u1ebft.  Today, suburbia encroaches on depleted coffee plantations and desiccated scrub.  Aside from concerns over the long-term ecological trajectories under anthropogenic pressures in ostensibly communist or capitalist inspired systems and, notwithstanding today\u2019s very different context, the detailed investigation into aspects of the War provides strategic metaphors involving fiscal re-calibration, governance hierarchy or incentive regulations, hubristic corrections and ecological transformation", "filtered_title": ["academ", "letter", "french", "indochina", "war", "metaphor", "strateg", "insight", "simon", "huston", "pandem", "militari", "catastroph", "illustr", "system", "fragil", "impel", "strateg", "reflect", "french", "indochina", "war", "fiw", "1946", "1954", "furnish", "use", "insight", "reson", "current", "infecti", "climat", "pollut", "econom", "secur", "challeng", "five", "strateg", "theme", "structur", "analysi", "histor", "literatur", "reason", "french", "failur", "1954", "involv", "fundament", "regim", "illegitimaci", "polit", "equivoc", "intellig", "shortcom", "strateg", "oper", "failur", "also", "determin", "strength", "adapt", "vi\u1ec7t", "minh", "vm", "1945", "franc", "occupi", "vietnam", "assert", "global", "credenti", "later", "cold", "war", "logic", "american", "aid", "sustain", "la", "sale", "guerr", "howev", "conflict", "mere", "delay", "bloodi", "inevit", "post", "coloni", "regim", "shift", "maintain", "american", "aid", "flow", "yet", "retain", "french", "region", "influenc", "command", "expeditionari", "corp", "henri", "navarr", "adopt", "offens", "stanc", "sought", "crush", "vm", "breath", "life", "moribund", "french", "union", "l", "union", "fran\u00e7ais", "block", "gi\u00e1p", "feint", "lao", "novemb", "1954", "insert", "fortifi", "camp", "remot", "di\u00ean", "bi\u00ean", "ph\u00fa", "dbp", "howev", "navarr", "ignor", "lesson", "h\u00f2a", "b\u00ecnh", "1950", "51", "ngh\u0129a", "l\u1ed9", "1951", "misread", "n\u00e0", "s\u1ea3n", "1952", "underestim", "vm", "capabl", "oper", "distanc", "dbp", "hanoi", "stretch", "french", "aero", "logist", "system", "limit", "navarr", "also", "divert", "resourc", "sideshow", "op\u00e9rat", "atlant", "gi\u00e1p", "realis", "navarr", "taken", "bait", "seal", "besieg", "camp", "five", "divis", "includ", "artilleri", "one", "13th", "march", "vm", "attack", "conquer", "garrison", "56", "day", "even", "7", "8th", "may", "1954", "navarr", "gambl", "spectacular", "backfir", "militarili", "french", "expeditionari", "corp", "might", "recov", "even", "consid", "bloodbath", "mang", "yang", "pass", "almost", "seven", "week", "later", "howev", "psycholog", "blow", "unmask", "regim", "financi", "polit", "bankruptci", "power", "drain", "away", "american", "communist", "whilst", "french", "indochina", "perpetu", "iniquit", "social", "structur", "taint", "racism", "symbol", "physic", "violenc", "arguabl", "also", "protect", "minor", "spurn", "dictatorship", "transfer", "cultur", "technolog", "strike", "find", "emerg", "investig", "incred", "transform", "geographi", "vietnam", "sinc", "1948", "tiger", "eleph", "roam", "jungl", "160km", "north", "west", "saigon", "near", "phan", "thi\u1ebft", "today", "suburbia", "encroach", "deplet", "coffe", "plantat", "desicc", "scrub", "asid", "concern", "long", "term", "ecolog", "trajectori", "anthropogen", "pressur", "ostens", "communist", "capitalist", "inspir", "system", "notwithstand", "today", "differ", "context", "detail", "investig", "aspect", "war", "provid", "strateg", "metaphor", "involv", "fiscal", "calibr", "govern", "hierarchi", "incent", "regul", "hubrist", "correct", "ecolog", "transform"]}, "54e04c02-3d82-4390-92ab-4b0e3f533fa8": {"title": "Accounting and smart cities: New evidence for governmentality and politics", "author_name": "Loai Alsaid, Jean Claude  Mutiganda", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/accounting-and-smart-cities-new-evidence-for-governmentality-and-", "date": "9 Apr 2020", "data_desc": "The concept of a smart city has attracted the attention of many scholars and policymakers in many countries worldwide.

Drawing on the concept of governmentality, the authors conducted a case study based on document analysis, meetings observation, and 42 semi-structured interviews at a branch of a hybrid electricity company owned by New Cairo City in Egypt, during 2018. Findings show that the case company has implemented smart distribution networks of electricity in which new management accounting technology (enterprise resource planning (ERP) system) is used to trace costs, revenues, client complaints and feedback in a timely manner. The new network (of infrastructure and technologies) has represented timely accounting information as a major political power to influence accurate governance decision-making, such as smart electricity pricing and control, and to challenge governance decisions that are not sound.

We investigate ways to increase the reliability of exponential smoothing forecasts, the most widely used family of forecasting models in business forecasting. We consider two alternative sets of approaches, one stemming from statistics and one from machine learning. To this end, we adapt M-estimators, boosting and inverse boosting to parameter estimation for exponential smoothing. We propose appropriate modifications that are necessary for time series forecasting while aiming to obtain scalable algorithms. We evaluate the various estimation methods using multiple real datasets and find that several approaches outperform the widely used maximum likelihood estimation.

Technology in sport has made great strides, allowing both amateurs and even more professionals to use innovative technical solutions that can improve performance: first of all during training and then, consequently, in official competitions. Innovations both in the field of materials, but above all in terms of tools for verifying correct training through the collection of a large number of data, turned into carefully analysed useful information. There are sports that have benefited most from these new technologies, based on their particular characteristics. This research focused on a systematic analysis of the most important technologies that are currently allowing great progress in sports performance and in the impartiality of competitions through the analysis of the collected data.

This paper proposes a decision rule-based approach to address this issue. This approach relies on the Dominance-Based Rough Approach (DRSA), which is a well-known multicriteria sorting method. The outputs of DRSA are a collection of if-then decision rules and a collection of attribute reducts. In this paper, new measures are proposed for calculating the relative importance of condition attributes based on the characteristics of decision rules and of attribute reducts. Decision rule-based measures are parameterised in order to consider the characteristics of decision rules using both learning and testing datasets. The proposed measures can be aggregated into a comprehensive measure indicating the overall importance of each condition attribute. Furthermore, the proposed measures are extended in order to compute the relative importance of a collection of condition attributes taken together. In addition, decision rule-based measures are extended to evaluate the relative importance of specific values of condition attributes.

Our findings show that firms deploy four context-fitting but ethically suspect political strategies: affective, financial, pseudo-attribution and kinship strategies. We leverage this understanding to contribute to CPA in emerging countries by arguing that corporate political strategies are shaped by the reciprocity and duality of dependency relationships between firms and politicians, and also by advancing that these strategies reflect institutional weaknesses and unique industry-level opportunities.

The research paper starts from the reality that finance plays an important role in each economy. Nowadays, finance has to manage and adapt to Digital Era. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to identify and encourage managing financial statements through artificial intelligence using XBRL and Blockchain. In many countries, financial and tax authorities encourage the adoption of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and Blockchain. XBRL enable business to generate their required reporting information directly from their financial data. Blockchain technology continues to grow and it is being used in more and more business sectors. Finance, accounting and auditing has been identified as areas that could greatly benefit the distributed registry and other features of Blockchain. The main benefits generated by these innovative tools include reducing the risk of error (especially human error); low risk of fraud; system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow. The research paper comes to present how artificial intelligence combine financial information with tech capabilities, accelerate digital transformation of finance and accounting, and may create a more safety business and economic environment, reducing human error.

More importantly, our findings offer robust support for the hypothesis that the impact of the crisis is less pronounced for firms whose financial statements are more exposed to fair value accounting. This evidence can be explained by the increased valuation weight placed by investors on the book value of equity relative to net income for firms with more exposure to fair value in the pre-crisis period.

This analysis was supplemented with estimating a fixed-effects and two-stage least squares regression models to address any concerns regarding the possible existence of endogeneity problems.FindingsThis study reports three key findings. First, the authors find that early ISAs adoption has a negative effect on several financial market consequences, namely stock market integration, market capitalisation, market turnover, market return, market development, stock price volatility and stock trading volume. Second, using an alternative measure to the one that is proposed by DOI theory, the authors found that some financial indicators have been significantly improved after ISAs adoption, but only for listed firms that prepared their financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards and audited by ISAs simultaneously. Finally, the financialindicators of European stock markets, however, have insignificantly shrank post the mandatory adoption of ISAs in 2006.Practical implicationsThe empirical evidence raises questions about how ISAs were enforced and implemented. For example, countries that adopted ISAs at early stages may have been dominated mostly by recently established stock exchanges. This implies a crucial need to determine and apply the best type of auditing regime that can increase investors trust and enhance the credibility of stock markets information, which might ultimately advance the FMIs over time significantly.Originality/valueTo-date, studies investigating the impact of the adoption of ISAs on FMI from a DOI theory perspective are virtually non-existent.

Specifically, we suggest a parsimonious reflected gamma specification under the GAS framework, consider other GAS special cases and the Exponential Weights driven nonparametric methods, which fall into the same modelling category as the well-known and widely recognised original RiskMetrics\u2122 approach. We focus on the returns for BTC, LTC and ETH and find that progress upon RiskMetricks\u2122 may provide valuable gains in exposure modelling of Cryptocurrencies under the rough and primary backtesting conditions, though not all of the considered approaches demonstrate consistency at the selected risk confidence levels. In our setting, Laplace GAS specification, which controls for time-variation both in scale (volatility) and skewness (asymmetric responses to positive and negative volatility) parameters, performs the best at the most of the levels. We also find that controlling for time-variation in the degrees of freedom (tails) of the Student's  may be a worthwhile consideration, though such approach may still yield more conservative investors\u2019 strategies than its Laplace asymmetric alternative. Reflected gamma and Extreme Value Theory linked Double Pareto specifications also demonstrate a modest performance, but likely suffer from the lack of asymmetry in their parameters, as our Reflected Gamma parametrisation accounts for time-variation in the tails, unlike Pareto specifications and does not outperform asymmetric Laplace specification.

The findings reveal a significant mismatch, indicating that the traditional fraud triangle model is not suitable for the assessment of FFRR. Auditors should not only focus on which factors to consider in fraud risk assessment, but also on the relative importance of the factors.

The authors suggest that integrated thinking is an internal process that organizations can follow to increase the level of disclosure on IR that can be used as an effective mechanism to enhance accountability with stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) guidelines and content analysis are used to analyze IR content elements in HEI reports from 2014-2016. Findings: The results indicate a significant increase in the trend and extent of IR content elements. The HEI-specific characteristics examined, such as establishment of HEI; adoption of IR framework and governing board size are all statistically and positively associated with IR content elements disclosure. This paper introduces signalling theory to explore the idea that appropriate communication via integrated thinking can close the gap between the organization and its stakeholders via increased level of disclosure on IR content elements. Practical implications: The results will assist policymakers and regulators to assess the benefits of voluntary implementation of IR at HEIs and evaluate possible mandatory implementation of IIRC guidelines. Second, the findings can assist managers of institutions interested in implementing IR. Social implications: This study recommends universities to explicitly address IR issues in reporting, as this will increase their impact as leaders of educational thought in addition to their roles as partners, advisors, counselors and assessors.

Our theoretic model demonstrates that the ambiguous relationship between hedging and firm value may be due to a subtle combination of economic (managerial self-interest, agency problems/moral hazard, managerial ability, managerial risk aversion) and behavioural factors (overconfidence). Our empirical analysis confirms the ambiguous effect of hedging on firm performance. Empirically, we focus on the use of derivatives in the corporate hedging of three types of financial risk (foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks), and examine the effect on value and performance of listed UK corporations during 2005-2017.

This research analyses the performance of professional European football teams that are publicly listed on stock markets, analysing their income statements and factoring in how the value-added perspective is impacting professional sport.

In this paper, the authors apply a slightly modified and simplified version of this value-added approach to all publicly listed European football clubs and use these as a proxy for wider professional sport.

Our analysis shows that firms capital structure significantly influences by the coalition of shareholders particularly decisions about leverage financing in addition to the firms' specific characteristics and institutional arrangements. Our empirical evidence shows that controlling shareholders with a lower fraction of equity are more concerned about limited holding thus prefer leverage over equity financing to inflate their equity stake to protect them from the potential takeovers and mergers.

Within this framework, banks are able to sell mortgages to a financial vehicle corporation, which finances its activity by creating mortgage-backed securities and selling them to a mutual fund. In turn, the mutual fund collects liquidity by selling shares to households and remunerates them with a monthly interest. The impact of this mechanism is analysed by means of computational experiments for different levels of banks\u2019 securitisation propensity. Furthermore, we study a set of systemic risk indicators which have the aim of assessing the imbalances in the financial system. Two of them are the mortgage-to-GDP ratio and the capital adequacy ratio, which are constructed to detect only the on-balance sheet changes in banks\u2019 credit exposure. We consider two additional indicators, similar to the previous ones with the only difference that they are also able to account for the off-balance sheet items. Moreover, we adopt an indicator, the so-called \u201cvirtuous\u2013unvirtuous cycle\u201d indicator, which, besides off-balance assets, targets also the GDP. The results show that higher securitisation propensity weakens the financial stability of banks with relevant effects on different sectors of the economy.

Unlikely events, but catastrophic, are the so-called \"black swans\"[1], and represent the nightmare of those who rely on the Gaussian approach, since, even if they fall into the tails of the bell, they represent a non-negligible threat. Studies on the black swan, especially after the events linked to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, have brought to light the so-called fractal approach that comes closest to the occurrence of most natural events. The analysis of big data, focused on the identification of the black swan, can follow different paths, in any case, the \"normal\"Gauss curve, as demonstrated, does not lend itself to this type of analysis, therefore most of the statistical tools which are based on this are not suitable for these analyses. This research highlights and tries to demonstrate how the fractal approach, combined with quantum technology, could really represent a great advance in the reliability of future predictions and the detection of black swans.

Colonisation left behind legacies of institutional framework, social ties and remnants of companies of colonial masters, which could potentially offer contemporary businesses from home countries the benefits of country of origin agglomeration. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses sequential explanatory mixed research design through 101 questionnaires and 8 interviews from the UK companies with FDI in Ghana. This approached enabled the initial quantitative results to be explored further through the qualitative data. Findings: Colonial ties have limited influence on contemporary flow of FDI to Ghana, in spite of the institutional legacies between former colonisers and colonies. Majority of UK companies are influenced by agglomeration opportunities in general rather than country of origin agglomeration. However, country of origin agglomeration remains important to over a third of the companies surveyed. Research limitations/implications: The sample was taken from the non-extractive industry in Ghana, and caution must be applied in generalising the findings. However, some universal issues concerning agglomeration and institutions are discussed. Originality/value: Although there has been some research on colonial history and its impact on FDI in Africa, existing knowledge on bilateral relations is rather limited. Unlike previous studies, this research provides depth by examining colonial influence on FDI between two countries, using two key concepts: country of origin agglomeration and institutions. It provides UK companies with contemporary views to consider when exploring FDI opportunities in Ghana, particularly in relation to the effects of the colonial history. It also provides investment promotion agencies with empirical results on the importance of various forms of agglomeration and institutions for FDI attraction.", "filtered_title": ["effect", "coloni", "legaci", "africa", "inward", "fdi", "case", "uk", "fdi", "ghana", "collin", "osei", "maktoba", "omar", "suliman", "joosub", "purpos", "purpos", "paper", "examin", "role", "coloni", "tie", "play", "attract", "foreign", "direct", "invest", "fdi", "ghana", "sever", "year", "offici", "end", "colonis", "african", "contin", "colonis", "left", "behind", "legaci", "institut", "framework", "social", "tie", "remnant", "compani", "coloni", "master", "could", "potenti", "offer", "contemporari", "busi", "home", "countri", "benefit", "countri", "origin", "agglomer", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "paper", "use", "sequenti", "explanatori", "mix", "research", "design", "101", "questionnair", "8", "interview", "uk", "compani", "fdi", "ghana", "approach", "enabl", "initi", "quantit", "result", "explor", "qualit", "data", "find", "coloni", "tie", "limit", "influenc", "contemporari", "flow", "fdi", "ghana", "spite", "institut", "legaci", "former", "colonis", "coloni", "major", "uk", "compani", "influenc", "agglomer", "opportun", "general", "rather", "countri", "origin", "agglomer", "howev", "countri", "origin", "agglomer", "remain", "import", "third", "compani", "survey", "research", "limit", "implic", "sampl", "taken", "non", "extract", "industri", "ghana", "caution", "must", "appli", "generalis", "find", "howev", "univers", "issu", "concern", "agglomer", "institut", "discuss", "origin", "valu", "although", "research", "coloni", "histori", "impact", "fdi", "africa", "exist", "knowledg", "bilater", "relat", "rather", "limit", "unlik", "previous", "studi", "research", "provid", "depth", "examin", "coloni", "influenc", "fdi", "two", "countri", "use", "two", "key", "concept", "countri", "origin", "agglomer", "institut", "provid", "uk", "compani", "contemporari", "view", "consid", "explor", "fdi", "opportun", "ghana", "particular", "relat", "effect", "coloni", "histori", "also", "provid", "invest", "promot", "agenc", "empir", "result", "import", "various", "form", "agglomer", "institut", "fdi", "attract"]}, "c3e8cb30-ead7-4847-8872-f245b25910c2": {"title": "The effect of say on pay on CEO compensation and spill-over effect on corporate cash holdings: Evidence from Australia", "author_name": "Muhammad Atif, Benjamin Liu, Allen Huang", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effect-of-say-on-pay-on-ceo-compensation-and-spill-over-effec", "date": "Dec 2020", "data_desc": "We examine the impact of Australia's Remuneration Amendment Act 2011 on CEO compensation and its spill-over effect on cash holdings to better understand how the new legislation affects the principal\u2013agent relationship.

Nonetheless, after more than ten years since the 13th Onshore Licensing Round, the fracking industry is said to have benefited from just \u00a3400 million - \u00a3500 million of estimated investments and only one partially fracked well with yet an uncertain fate of commercial production. This paradox motivated the current research. Based on a discounted cash flow model, the economic feasibility of the tax regime was evaluated with a  special interest in the pad allowance [PA], a major incentive of the fiscal regime. We find that the design of the fiscal regime well achieves the Government's financial objectives, but fails to support shale gas investments at lower gas prices. PA introduces further variability in investor cash flows, ultimately defeating the ethos of the incentive. We propose a reduction in the overall tax rate from 40% to no more than 21%; a removal of the additional tax charge (Supplementary Charge) and an amendment of PA rules to; (1) allow an extension of RFES to PA; (2) permit transfer of activated PA across companies in the same group; and (3) redefine capital expenditure to include intermediate well retirement costs necessary to drill new wells to stimulate production. Such a tax strategy would simplify and align the UK fiscal regime with practices across the US, China, Algeria and Canada. Importantly, it would better match the risk of shale gas investments to its rewards and could better attract investments.

The purpose of the article is to study the features and principles of online banking on the example of the Italian bank WIDIBA. Methodical support of the paper includes a method of analysis of specific situations. The key components of the case method of the study are: research on the basis of literature review; formalization of key theses (issues) in the context of the unresolved part of the study; accumulation and analysis of collected information; identification of key features of the issue. This research was carried out in the light of two aspects: the strategic principles of the spread of online banking in Italy; digital technologies in the context of the strategic perspective of the Italian bank WIDIBA. The paper considers the historical aspects of the introduction and use of online banking services. It is noted that in Italy today there are 207 publicly registered commercial establishments, of which 81 are located abroad, and 6 operate mostly in the format of providing online banking services. The object of this research is the activity of the Italian bank WIDIBA, which is justified by its valuable practical experience in formalizing a plan of adequate timely strategy for entering the market of online banking services on the basis of a carefully developed development strategy. The theoretical researches were carried out in the work, in particular, in the following directions: definition of strategic actions of bank establishment according to a time lag of functioning; analysis of the budget of the banking institution (net profitability, interest margin, operating and administrative expenses, etc.); analysis of the income statement of the bank (the ratio of net profit and loss, interest margin and brokerage margin); work with financial report or balance sheet data on the structure of assets, liabilities and investments, retained earnings; study of trend dynamics of cash flows (operational, financial, investment and free cash flows).

All these aspects, in general, in order to lead the company towards success, must be integrated with each other. Many software can manage all these aspects of management, but they do not allow integrated management and top management cannot control and reconcile all information. For this reason Enterprise resource plannings (ERPs), formed by different modules, are very common. ERPs allow the flow of information to be managed in an integrated manner using a single system, avoiding duplication, errors and loss and information. All the operations are reported systematically also and above all on the accounting module, which is the one that guides all the others. This research paper is focused on the comparison of currently most used AISs and ERPs in the UAE, also analyzing the market and the size of businesses in the area.

There is also no discernible mapping between alpha and a bank's own propensity to subsidise cash returns. This paper instead develops a new theoretical model for bank-specific alpha that is estimated for 43 Islamic banks in 11 countries. Our alpha values broadly correspond with those of the IFSB.

Based on a combination of Factor Analysis (FA), Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) and Parameter Sensitivity Analysis, the research explores an optimal scenario of a company\u2019s share of revenue that optimised CBM development contracts. We find that a combination of 5 years straight line depreciation (SLD), 5% First Tranche Petroleum (FTP), 78% Contractor Share (CS) and 35% income tax best spreads the risk of CBM development and exploitation between the government and the contractor. This combination is a more suitable PSC regime for developing CBM in an early stage of the industry. Therefore, the Government must cede some taxes during exploration to incentivise CBM development. Three PSCs regimes are thus required to fully develop and exploit CBM, including exploration, transitional and exploitation phase PSCs which better match contractor risks and returns and ensure reasonable certainty of contractor cost recovery.", "filtered_title": ["coalb", "methan", "develop", "indonesia", "design", "econom", "analysi", "upstream", "petroleum", "fiscal", "polici", "elijah", "acquah", "andoh", "herdi", "putra", "augustin", "ifelebuegu", "andrew", "owusu", "due", "increas", "demand", "natur", "gas", "indonesia", "govern", "promot", "explor", "coalb", "methan", "cbm", "current", "indonesia", "453", "trillion", "cubic", "feet", "tcf", "cbm", "reserv", "howev", "cbm", "develop", "countri", "still", "explor", "phase", "signific", "invest", "attract", "investor", "tailor", "product", "share", "contract", "psc", "regim", "requir", "base", "combin", "factor", "analysi", "fa", "discount", "cash", "flow", "dcf", "paramet", "sensit", "analysi", "research", "explor", "optim", "scenario", "compani", "share", "revenu", "optimis", "cbm", "develop", "contract", "find", "combin", "5", "year", "straight", "line", "depreci", "sld", "5", "first", "tranch", "petroleum", "ftp", "78", "contractor", "share", "cs", "35", "incom", "tax", "best", "spread", "risk", "cbm", "develop", "exploit", "govern", "contractor", "combin", "suitabl", "psc", "regim", "develop", "cbm", "earli", "stage", "industri", "therefor", "govern", "must", "cede", "tax", "explor", "incentivis", "cbm", "develop", "three", "pscs", "regim", "thus", "requir", "fulli", "develop", "exploit", "cbm", "includ", "explor", "transit", "exploit", "phase", "pscs", "better", "match", "contractor", "risk", "return", "ensur", "reason", "certainti", "contractor", "cost", "recoveri"]}, "b046cb98-d485-47a3-91c1-3ba6c8d67a40": {"title": "Commonality in liquidity across options and stock futures markets", "author_name": "Bouchra Benzennou, Owain ap Gwilym, Gwion Williams", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/commonality-in-liquidity-across-options-and-stock-futures-markets", "date": "28 Jan 2019", "data_desc": "This study investigates the existence of common aggregate factors driving liquidity  across different markets.

Despite the global market prevalence of sukuk, asset pricing literature has not yet addressed the pricing mechanism of sukuk, which is inherently different from bonds and equity due to the contractual differences. However, analysts use LIBOR, or the Islamic interbank benchmark rate (IIBR), as the ad-hoc benchmark to evaluate sukuk performance. In this study, we develop a basic pricing model that captures the common risks in sukuk returns.

Our evidence will be of value to China in policy development and practice, as well as to other economies that have pursued, or will pursue, similar trajectories.

Unlike the banks, insurance companies are not operating under a unique set of governance standards appropriate for the nature of their business. It means Insurance firms are more susceptible to agency problems in comparison to banks. Taking this context into account, we investigate if board quality varies across banking and insurance firms. The study based on eight years' data for 455 banks and 137 insurance firms from 28 countries finds that insurance firms have a low-quality corporate board as compared to banks. The reasons include: Insurance firms, in comparison to banks, are less likely to have an audit committee and infrequently meeting if they have an audit committee, high existence of CEO duality and involvement in the nomination committees, long-serving CEOs, gender imbalance in the board, fewer independent directors, and higher percentage of directors' ownership.

Audit committees, external audits and internal audits were the main mechanisms used by these banks to enhance board accountability.

The pro-social consumption does not differ significantly among different demographic groups.Research limitations/implicationsTo explore the external motivational factors in consumers\u2019 decision making will be a potential research direction in future.Practical implicationsThe empirical results provide implications for UK apparel marketers and policy makers to engage and motivate socially responsible consumers so as to reap strategic rewards for their CSR efforts.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to the knowledge of socially responsible consumption and how it is affected by CSR.", "filtered_title": ["csr", "consumpt", "paradox", "examin", "uk", "apparel", "compani", "mei", "yu", "dongmei", "cao", "juh", "yan", "tan", "purposedespit", "extens", "studi", "various", "aspect", "corpor", "social", "respons", "csr", "effect", "consum", "behaviour", "less", "explor", "grow", "amount", "research", "concern", "phenomenon", "csr", "minor", "effect", "actual", "purchas", "although", "csr", "practic", "enhanc", "consum", "purchas", "intent", "document", "csr", "consumpt", "paradox", "yet", "resolv", "purpos", "paper", "understand", "paradox", "design", "methodolog", "approachquestionnair", "administ", "face", "face", "consum", "birmingham", "questionnair", "concern", "consum", "behaviour", "relat", "csr", "practic", "21", "popular", "apparel", "compani", "uk", "findingsresult", "suggest", "consum", "pro", "social", "prioriti", "signific", "relat", "pro", "social", "consumpt", "consum", "awar", "csr", "practic", "insignific", "associ", "purchas", "behaviour", "pro", "social", "consumpt", "differ", "signific", "among", "differ", "demograph", "group", "research", "limit", "implicationsto", "explor", "extern", "motiv", "factor", "consum", "decis", "make", "potenti", "research", "direct", "futur", "practic", "implicationsth", "empir", "result", "provid", "implic", "uk", "apparel", "market", "polici", "maker", "engag", "motiv", "social", "respons", "consum", "reap", "strateg", "reward", "csr", "effort", "origin", "valuethi", "paper", "contribut", "knowledg", "social", "respons", "consumpt", "affect", "csr"]}, "2c4192c4-a5e6-4693-92b0-068c75c1638c": {"title": "Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure: an economic perspective", "author_name": "Piotr Lis, Jacob Mendel", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/cyberattacks-on-critical-infrastructure-an-economic-perspective", "date": "Jun 2019", "data_desc": "The aim of this article is to analyze the economic aspects of cybersecurity of critical infrastructure defined as physical or virtual systems and assets that are vital to a country\u2019s functioning and whose incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national, economic, military and public security.

Using a large sample of UK firms from the FTSE All-Share Index over the 2003\u20132011 period, we show a positive correlation between the presence of compensation consultants and CEO pay. Importantly, isolating this effect is somewhat dependent on the endogenous selection of consultants and the statistical modelling strategy deployed.

The emphasis is on assessing transparency and disclosure; auditing and compliance; risk management as indicators of corporate governance; and understanding how these parameters affect bank profitability, liquidity and the quality of loan portfolios. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 20 financial institutions was selected, with ten respondents from each, yielding a total sample size of 200. Principal component analysis (PCA), with inbuilt ability to check for composite reliability, was used to obtain composite indices for the corporate governance indicators as well as the indicators of financial performance, based on a set of questions framed for each institution. Findings: The analysis demonstrates that greater disclosure and transparency, improved auditing and compliance and better risk management positively affect the financial performance of financial institutions. In terms of significance, the results show that as the level of disclosure and transparency in managerial affairs increases, the performance of financial institutions \u2013 as measured in terms of the quality of loan portfolios, liquidity and profitability \u2013 increases by 0.3046, with the effect being statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Furthermore, as the level of auditing and the degree of compliance with banking regulations increases, the financial performance of banks improves by 0.3309. Research limitations/implications: This paper did not consider time series because corporate governance does not change periodically. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates the importance of disclosure and transparency in managerial affairs because the performance of financial institutions, as measured in terms of loan portfolios, liquidity and profitability, increases by 0.4 when transparency and disclosure improve, with this effect being statistically significant at the 1 per cent level.

This study builds on previous research at Coventry University (Williamson and Wick 2013 and Smith et al 2017) in order to see if the high E Irates recorded at Coventry University are replicated across other institutions. It reports on the response of students from two UK HEI Business Schools (Coventry and Birmingham City University \u2013 BCU), entering undergraduate study in 2018. The study will compare data collected during induction week, before any formal teaching has commenced .FindingsThe study confirms findings from previous studies and demonstrates that students from both institutions recorded higher than normal levels of EI. However, there were several differences between the student responses from the two institutions and these are discussed later in the paper.Contribution This study explores the EI of students during the university induction period in the moment prior to starting their formal HE studies.

However, this paper develops a two-step approach to estimate the substitution and output effects of changes in energy demand resulting from changes in prices and further examines the implications of these effects on CO\n              2 emissions using European industrial dataset over the period 1995\u20132007. In our empirical estimations, instead of relying only on iSUR model like previous studies, we introduced a multilevel model, which is a more befitting model to our data. Our analysis covers industry as a whole and for different sector types. The primary results emerged from our analysis suggest a strong evidence using the multilevel model. Generally, our results show that production inputs are substitutable.

Design/methodology/approach: Acquirers\u2019 systematic risk (beta) is calculated using the capital asset pricing model. The change in acquirers\u2019 beta post-merger is obtained using event study and tested for mean differences across various sub-categories of deals. Cross-sectional regressions are then performed to test several hypotheses relating to the impact of diversification, method of payment, target status and prior experience on acquirers\u2019 risk. Findings: For the overall sample, the evidence suggests that acquirers\u2019 beta tends to increase post-merger, but only in cases where their pre-merger risk is relatively low in relation to the risk of the market. The authors also show that cash payment deals for publicly listed targets contribute to reducing acquirers\u2019 risk while stock payment increase risk. Diversification, whether global or across industry, has no significant impact on risk. On the other hand, for serial acquirers, the risk is increased significantly with more M&As. Originality/value: This study contributes in a unique way by providing global evidence on acquirers\u2019 systematic risk using a very large and diverse sample of M&A deals and investigating not only the impact of diversification on risk but also of other deal characteristics (e.g. method of payment, target status, acquirers\u2019 prior experience) which have not been previously examined.", "filtered_title": ["merger", "acquisit", "implic", "acquir", "market", "risk", "sailesh", "tanna", "ibrahim", "yousef", "purpos", "purpos", "paper", "investig", "impact", "merger", "acquisit", "acquir", "compani", "systemat", "risk", "use", "global", "sampl", "34", "221", "complet", "deal", "occur", "year", "1977", "2012", "cover", "163", "countri", "85", "industri", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "acquir", "systemat", "risk", "beta", "calcul", "use", "capit", "asset", "price", "model", "chang", "acquir", "beta", "post", "merger", "obtain", "use", "event", "studi", "test", "mean", "differ", "across", "various", "sub", "categori", "deal", "cross", "section", "regress", "perform", "test", "sever", "hypothes", "relat", "impact", "diversif", "method", "payment", "target", "status", "prior", "experi", "acquir", "risk", "find", "overal", "sampl", "evid", "suggest", "acquir", "beta", "tend", "increas", "post", "merger", "case", "pre", "merger", "risk", "relat", "low", "relat", "risk", "market", "author", "also", "show", "cash", "payment", "deal", "public", "list", "target", "contribut", "reduc", "acquir", "risk", "stock", "payment", "increas", "risk", "diversif", "whether", "global", "across", "industri", "signific", "impact", "risk", "hand", "serial", "acquir", "risk", "increas", "signific", "origin", "valu", "studi", "contribut", "uniqu", "way", "provid", "global", "evid", "acquir", "systemat", "risk", "use", "larg", "divers", "sampl", "deal", "investig", "impact", "diversif", "risk", "also", "deal", "characterist", "e", "g", "method", "payment", "target", "status", "acquir", "prior", "experi", "previous", "examin"]}, "377f11a9-661b-477d-96cf-72b657151e47": {"title": "Multi Academy Trusts in England: A scenario of cooperation with universities", "author_name": "H.K.

This suggests that investors place more emphasis on the unrecognised intangible features of SOBC contracts during the crisis, even though their associated expenses are subject to managerial discretion and measurement errors. We also find that the positive relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns over the financial crisis is more pronounced when ownership is more concentrated.

This subject is important for two reasons: firstly, the survival of an Islamic financial market and its institutions is hugely dependent on its risk factors and stress testing management approaches. Secondly, the ability of managing such market shocks without compromising Shari\u2019ah requirements is a very important component for Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). The study collects its data by using the method of a case study to obtain in-depth knowledge from the Bank of England and IFIs in the UK.

In addition, this study measures the level of EM using two different methods: accrual\u2010based EM (AEM) and real activity\u2010based EM (REM). In general, REM is regarded as more costly but less detectable, while AEM is regarded as less costly but more detectable, owing to the fact that AEM is subject to greater scrutiny from auditors and regulators. The results show that Chinese firms\u2019 enhanced CSR generally decreases their EM practices.

While the concept of \u2018space\u2019 is open to interpretation, in the context of this study it is viewed from two perspective: firstly, the individual entrepreneurial universities as discrete spaces and secondly, the regional context of the West Midland as an overall shared space inhabited by MSMEs. The distances between these spaces is often mediate through various policy initiatives, which aim to create economic sustainability (Marrewijk 2003, Pojasek 2007, Samujh 2011) and growth in the region through its MSMEs (Martins & Mawson 1980, Gibbs 2000, Lundstrum et al 2014). This research explores the effectiveness and impact of policy as a mechanism for mediation and the viability of policy as a mechanism for ongoing sustainability and growth (Ham & Hill 1993, Hart 2003, Huggins & Williams 2009). \n\nAims\n\nThis research aimed to determine if a model of sustainable business support could be developed for MSMEs that is not dependent on \u2018public\u2019 funding as a keystone. This paper examines the national and regional business support agenda; the support needs of MSMEs; the role of universities (or HEIs) in the provision of business support, and the needs of public funding bodies with regards to economic sustainability and growth of MSMEs in the West Midlands.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis interpretivist study utilises semi-structured interviews with key post holders from West Midland\u2019s universities. Four universities were identified for participation in the study. They were selected to achieve a representative mixture of university classifications and geographical spread across the region. Individual participants were a representative blend of leaders (Vice of Deputy Vice Chancellor), senior managers (Pro-Vice Chancellor) and managers. The aim was to conduct sixteen interviews, (comprised of four per institution), however an unobjectionable minimum of two was considered acceptable. In addition, secondary data was drawn from publicly available reports, publications and the institutions\u2019 websites.   Through this understanding, the research produced a series of outcomes and identifiable trends, which in turn facilitated the creation of the conceptual model for business support, which is focus of this paper. \n\nContribution\n\nThe research demonstrates that funding is a \u2018keystone\u2019 of the support system across the region and it proposes a range of options to support providers, governments and the MSME community in order to address and re-balance the current in-balance in funding provision. It highlighted systemic challenges within the tripartite relationship between Business, Universities, and Governments (also referred to as the triple helix). A key finding is noticeably lack of underpinning research by the support providers themselves who tended to focus only on data that supported their bids. There is a lack of flexibility in public funding to address the bespoke needs for the MSME owners (see also Devins et al 2005).

Henceforth goal 3.8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals defines the priority areas to achieve UHC goals \u2013 equity in the use of health services, quality of care and financial protection, by 2030. Consequently, the key functions of a health financing system \u2013 revenue raising, pooling and purchasing, are at the core of a country\u2019s progress towards achieving UHC. The World Health Organisation has argued that in order to provide access to good quality health care services for all members of the population, the health financing system should avoid catastrophic health expenditure caused by large out-of-pocket payments and user fees; they dampen demand and create barriers to access especially for the poor. Typically, in Uganda, domestic private health expenditure is the dominant source of health sector financing contributing more than 50% of the total current health expenditure, with 40% as household out-of-pocket payments. We employed an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to estimate the relationship between health care financing sources and health outcomes using a health access and quality index as a proxy for health outcome. In our analysis, we posited that preventable (treatable) causes of death are a good measure of access to healthcare and quality of healthcare in the health system. We constructed a healthcare access and quality index based on three health indicators: Under-five mortality, DPT3 coverage, and Immunization against measles in Uganda, using the principal component analysis method. The index ranges between 0 and 100 whereby moving towards 100 signifies increasing level of health care access and quality. The study finds that an increase in the ratio of private to government health care financing has different impacts in the short run and long run. While in the short-run it increases access and quality of health care, in the long run it reduces access and quality of health care.  The findings suggest that reliance on private health care financing is not sustainable in the long run, if the country is to achieve the universal health coverage goals by 2030. Therefore, government ought to increase its share of health care financing to avoid the negative impact of relying on private health care financing in the long run.", "filtered_title": ["extent", "public", "privat", "financ", "sourc", "affect", "access", "qualiti", "health", "care", "experi", "uganda", "healthcar", "system", "judith", "kabajulizi", "qiaoyuan", "lin", "fred", "matovu", "58th", "world", "health", "assembl", "2005", "world", "leader", "commit", "attain", "univers", "health", "coverag", "uhc", "popul", "henceforth", "goal", "3", "8", "un", "sustain", "develop", "goal", "defin", "prioriti", "area", "achiev", "uhc", "goal", "equiti", "use", "health", "servic", "qualiti", "care", "financi", "protect", "2030", "consequ", "key", "function", "health", "financ", "system", "revenu", "rais", "pool", "purchas", "core", "countri", "progress", "toward", "achiev", "uhc", "world", "health", "organis", "argu", "order", "provid", "access", "good", "qualiti", "health", "care", "servic", "member", "popul", "health", "financ", "system", "avoid", "catastroph", "health", "expenditur", "caus", "larg", "pocket", "payment", "user", "fee", "dampen", "demand", "creat", "barrier", "access", "especi", "poor", "typic", "uganda", "domest", "privat", "health", "expenditur", "domin", "sourc", "health", "sector", "financ", "contribut", "50", "total", "current", "health", "expenditur", "40", "household", "pocket", "payment", "employ", "autoregress", "distribut", "lag", "ardl", "model", "estim", "relationship", "health", "care", "financ", "sourc", "health", "outcom", "use", "health", "access", "qualiti", "index", "proxi", "health", "outcom", "analysi", "posit", "prevent", "treatabl", "caus", "death", "good", "measur", "access", "healthcar", "qualiti", "healthcar", "health", "system", "construct", "healthcar", "access", "qualiti", "index", "base", "three", "health", "indic", "five", "mortal", "dpt3", "coverag", "immun", "measl", "uganda", "use", "princip", "compon", "analysi", "method", "index", "rang", "0", "100", "wherebi", "move", "toward", "100", "signifi", "increas", "level", "health", "care", "access", "qualiti", "studi", "find", "increas", "ratio", "privat", "govern", "health", "care", "financ", "differ", "impact", "short", "run", "long", "run", "short", "run", "increas", "access", "qualiti", "health", "care", "long", "run", "reduc", "access", "qualiti", "health", "care", "find", "suggest", "relianc", "privat", "health", "care", "financ", "sustain", "long", "run", "countri", "achiev", "univers", "health", "coverag", "goal", "2030", "therefor", "govern", "ought", "increas", "share", "health", "care", "financ", "avoid", "negat", "impact", "reli", "privat", "health", "care", "financ", "long", "run"]}, "b36c8692-95f0-45cf-832a-8ffd5bdb9a89": {"title": "Understanding Financial Reporting Fraud in Egypt: Evidence from the Audit Field", "author_name": "Rasha Kassem", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/understanding-financial-reporting-fraud-in-egypt-evidence-from-th", "date": "2 Nov 2019", "data_desc": "This study expands our knowledge and understanding of financial reporting fraud in Egypt by drawing on the perceptions of experienced international and Big 4 auditors in that country.

Thepurpose of the study is to deepen the analysis of European financial accounting practices, in particular in the context of the use of methodological support for the classification of the nature of accounts. Particular emphasis is placed on the evolution of accounting practices: an analysis of the major evolutionary stagesthat have occurred in different historical periods in accordance with the social needs of society and the economic and financial consequences of such transformational changes. The systematization of literary sources on the subject made it possible to identify three key stages of the evolutionary development ofaccounting and the essential nature of accounts, in particular: 1) the prerequisites for the emergence of financial and accounting, confirmed by a written accounting record dated 1494; 2) implementation of business continuity accounting based on the use of adjusting records and in-depth study of the nature and nature of accounts; 3) substantiation of the practical implementation of the triple record based on the implementation of blockchain technology. Based on the theoretical studies, the author substantiates the need to use in accounting practice a three-dimensional method of accounting by economic entities, which will more accurately reflect the financial transactions carried out by the company and avoid possible economic mistakes. The study postulates the need to integrate the third book within the accounting system.Summarizing, the author substantiates the need to develop in the future convergent methods of balancing the dual accounting system and maintaining accounts with the third book.

Design/methodology/approach - The empirical evidence is based on instrumental variable Fixed Effects regressions with overlapping and non-overlapping bank size thresholds to control for the QLH (Quiet Life Hypothesis). The QLH postulates that managers of large banks will use their privileges for private gains at the expense of making financial services more accessible to the general public. Financial access is measured with loan price and loan quantity whereas information asymmetry is implicit in the activities of public credit registries and private credit bureaus.  Findings - The findings with non-overlapping thresholds are broadly consistent with those that are conditional on overlapping thresholds. First, public credit registries have a decreasing effect on the price of loans with the magnitude of reduction comparable across all bank size thresholds. Second, both public credit registries and private credit bureaus enhance the quantity of loans. Third, compared with public credit registries,  private credit bureaus have a greater influence in increasing financial access because they have a significantly higher  favourable effect on the quantity  and price of loans Fourth, the QLH is not apparent because large banks are not associated with lower levels of financial access compared to small banks.

The study considered IBBL as the only sample because it is the only Islamic bank in Bangladesh which is the member of both AAOIFI and IFSB. Hence, this paper investigated the compliancestatus of IBBL as a member of AAOIFI and IFSB. The study examined the annual reports of 2008-2012 as these were the latest and contemporary reports in 2013 when the study was conducted. SPSS software version 22.0 was used to analyze the data. A total of 203 items under 13 categories of AAOIFI standard and 133 items under 17 categories of IFSB standard were considered. Ordinary least squares was run to test the hypotheses of the study.Findings \u2013 The study found that IBBL on an average complied 46.31 per cent of AAOIFI and 52.50 per cent of IFSB standards during the period, and importantly, IBBL did not comply some of the categories of required disclosures. The study also observed that size, as measured by total asset and number of branches, has a significant influence on compliance with IFSB standard, but not AAOIFI. The findings of the study depicted that IBBL did not reasonably recognize the importance of complying with AAOIFI and IFSB standards. Poor compliance or non-compliance with AAOIFI and IFSB accounting and reporting standards by IBBL exposed that the bank is not efficient in managing Shari`ah compliance risks, operational risks and transparent financial reporting. Therefore, recognition of the Shari`ah standards by the respective IFIs and a \u201cregulatorypush\u201d is vital for improving the level of compliance with these standards.Research limitations/implications \u2013 The study considered IBBL as the only sample of the study because it is the only Islamic bank in Bangladesh which holds the membership of both AAOIFI and IFSB. The fiscal years 2008-2012 only were selected to evaluate the compliance status of the AAOIFI and IFSB standards in preparation and presentation of the financial statements of IBBL for comparative analysis because IFSB standard for accounting and disclosure was formulated in 2007; hence, the study could not evaluate the compliance status before 2008.Practical implications \u2013 The study will help IBBL in identifying their limitations in complying AAOIFI and IFSB standards and also the regulators in designing the accounting and reporting frameworks in regulating Islamic banks in Bangladesh. The study would help IBBL in identifying the reasons for noncompliance,how improvement in compliance level may help the bank in mitigating Shari`ah compliance and operational risk and how new legal and institutional framework may improve the level of compliance with those standards.Social implications \u2013 The study observed that the AAOIFI and IFSB standards were set for increasing the level of Shari`ah compliance, but the compliance status showed that different classes of accounting and reporting were ignored from compliance by IBBL. This study will benefit the stakeholders in choosing aShari`ah-compliant bank.Originality/value \u2013 This is a unique study which considered both AAOIFI and IFSB accounting and reporting standards in evaluating the reporting compliance status of an Islamic bank and identified the influence of reporting compliance on managing Shari`ah compliance risks, operational risks and transparency. This study expects to instigate the Islamic banks in complying accounting and reporting standards for being Shari`ah-compliant.", "filtered_title": ["compar", "complianc", "status", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "standard", "empir", "evid", "islami", "bank", "bangladesh", "limit", "hafij", "ullah", "ruma", "khanam", "tabassum", "tasnim", "purpos", "paper", "aim", "examin", "complianc", "status", "account", "audit", "organ", "islam", "financi", "institut", "aaoifi", "financi", "account", "standard", "1", "islam", "financi", "servic", "board", "ifsb", "standard", "4", "islami", "bank", "bangladesh", "limit", "ibbl", "recogn", "regulatori", "influenc", "compli", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "standard", "identifi", "factor", "influenc", "complianc", "standard", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "present", "studi", "use", "content", "analysi", "approach", "investig", "complianc", "status", "studi", "consid", "ibbl", "sampl", "islam", "bank", "bangladesh", "member", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "henc", "paper", "investig", "compliancestatus", "ibbl", "member", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "studi", "examin", "annual", "report", "2008", "2012", "latest", "contemporari", "report", "2013", "studi", "conduct", "spss", "softwar", "version", "22", "0", "use", "analyz", "data", "total", "203", "item", "13", "categori", "aaoifi", "standard", "133", "item", "17", "categori", "ifsb", "standard", "consid", "ordinari", "least", "squar", "run", "test", "hypothes", "studi", "find", "studi", "found", "ibbl", "averag", "compli", "46", "31", "per", "cent", "aaoifi", "52", "50", "per", "cent", "ifsb", "standard", "period", "import", "ibbl", "compli", "categori", "requir", "disclosur", "studi", "also", "observ", "size", "measur", "total", "asset", "number", "branch", "signific", "influenc", "complianc", "ifsb", "standard", "aaoifi", "find", "studi", "depict", "ibbl", "reason", "recogn", "import", "compli", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "standard", "poor", "complianc", "non", "complianc", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "account", "report", "standard", "ibbl", "expos", "bank", "effici", "manag", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "risk", "oper", "risk", "transpar", "financi", "report", "therefor", "recognit", "shari", "ah", "standard", "respect", "ifi", "regulatorypush", "vital", "improv", "level", "complianc", "standard", "research", "limit", "implic", "studi", "consid", "ibbl", "sampl", "studi", "islam", "bank", "bangladesh", "hold", "membership", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "fiscal", "year", "2008", "2012", "select", "evalu", "complianc", "status", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "standard", "prepar", "present", "financi", "statement", "ibbl", "compar", "analysi", "ifsb", "standard", "account", "disclosur", "formul", "2007", "henc", "studi", "could", "evalu", "complianc", "status", "2008", "practic", "implic", "studi", "help", "ibbl", "identifi", "limit", "compli", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "standard", "also", "regul", "design", "account", "report", "framework", "regul", "islam", "bank", "bangladesh", "studi", "would", "help", "ibbl", "identifi", "reason", "noncompli", "improv", "complianc", "level", "may", "help", "bank", "mitig", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "oper", "risk", "new", "legal", "institut", "framework", "may", "improv", "level", "complianc", "standard", "social", "implic", "studi", "observ", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "standard", "set", "increas", "level", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "complianc", "status", "show", "differ", "class", "account", "report", "ignor", "complianc", "ibbl", "studi", "benefit", "stakehold", "choos", "ashari", "ah", "compliant", "bank", "origin", "valu", "uniqu", "studi", "consid", "aaoifi", "ifsb", "account", "report", "standard", "evalu", "report", "complianc", "status", "islam", "bank", "identifi", "influenc", "report", "complianc", "manag", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "risk", "oper", "risk", "transpar", "studi", "expect", "instig", "islam", "bank", "compli", "account", "report", "standard", "shari", "ah", "compliant"]}, "1d2e0bf3-0ec4-4a19-a8ec-8d0d289baf37": {"title": "Comparative Human Development Thresholds for Absolute and Relative Pro-poor Mobile Banking in Developing Countries", "author_name": "Simplice Asongu, Jacinta Nwachukwu", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/comparative-human-development-thresholds-for-absolute-and-relativ", "date": "5 Feb 2018", "data_desc": "Purpose: We assess the correlations between mobile banking and inclusive development (poverty and inequality) in 93 developing countries for the year 2011. Design/methodology/approachMobile banking entails: \u2018mobile phones used to pay bills\u2019 and \u2018mobile phones used to receive/send money\u2019, while the modifying policy indicator is the human development index (HDI). The data is decomposed into seven sub-panels based on two fundamental characteristics: (i) regions (Latin America, Asia and the Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, and Middle East and North Africa) and (ii) income levels (upper middle income, lower middle income and low income).FindingsOur results show that at certain thresholds of the HDI, mobile banking is positively linked to inclusive development. The following specific findings are established. First, the increased use of mobile phones to pay bills is negatively correlated with: (i) poverty in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), upper-middle-income countries (UMIC) and Latin American countries (LA) respectively at HDI thresholds of 0.725, 0.727 and 0.778 and (ii) inequality in UMIC and LA with HDI thresholds of respectively 0.646 and 0.761. Second, the increased use of mobile phones to send/receive money is negatively correlated with: (i) poverty in LMIC, UMIC and Central and Eastern European countries (CEE) with corresponding HDI thresholds of 0.631, 0.750 and 0.750 and (ii) inequality in UMIC, CEE and LA at HDI thresholds of 0.665, 0.736 and 0.726 respectively.

Those initiatives started with the objective of developing separate Islamic accounting standards. However, they have ended up with significantly heterogeneous objectives. Employing Institutional Logics Perspective (ILP) as a theoretical framework and case-study approach as a research design, this study provides comparative accounts into the role of selected institutional logics (religion, profession, market, community and state) in shaping two Islamic financial reporting standardisation projects initiated by the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the Malaysian Accounting Standard Board (MASB). Moreover, utilising ILP supplemented by remarks from the institutional entrepreneurship concept, this study examines the role of actors in initiating and then differently shaping the standardisation policies of these projects. Research findings informed by semi-structured interviews and document analysis indicate that Islamic financial reporting standardisation projects have been historically mapped by certain institutional logics. The dominance of those logics has experienced significant changes over time, resulting in subsequent changes in the standardisation strategies of those projects. Influential actors have also played an important role in shaping those projects through promoting certain organisational strategies in line with the institutional logics in which they are embedded This study concludes that the heterogeneity which AAOFI and MASB have shown in their standardisation strategies is attributed to: the relative dominance of certain logics in each institutional context; the centrality of those logics to organisational mission and goals; the extent to which prevailing institutional logics are represented within the organisation and the balance of power between different logics' representatives; and the extent to which actors have been able to promote their entrepreneurial vision and mobilise allies behind it.", "filtered_title": ["compet", "institut", "logic", "islam", "financi", "report", "standardis", "compar", "studi", "ahmad", "abra", "recognis", "account", "implic", "islam", "busi", "principl", "initi", "taken", "develop", "framework", "primarili", "aim", "serv", "financi", "report", "need", "islam", "financi", "industri", "initi", "start", "object", "develop", "separ", "islam", "account", "standard", "howev", "end", "signific", "heterogen", "object", "employ", "institut", "logic", "perspect", "ilp", "theoret", "framework", "case", "studi", "approach", "research", "design", "studi", "provid", "compar", "account", "role", "select", "institut", "logic", "religion", "profess", "market", "communiti", "state", "shape", "two", "islam", "financi", "report", "standardis", "project", "initi", "account", "audit", "organis", "islam", "financi", "institut", "aaoifi", "malaysian", "account", "standard", "board", "masb", "moreov", "utilis", "ilp", "supplement", "remark", "institut", "entrepreneurship", "concept", "studi", "examin", "role", "actor", "initi", "differ", "shape", "standardis", "polici", "project", "research", "find", "inform", "semi", "structur", "interview", "document", "analysi", "indic", "islam", "financi", "report", "standardis", "project", "histor", "map", "certain", "institut", "logic", "domin", "logic", "experienc", "signific", "chang", "time", "result", "subsequ", "chang", "standardis", "strategi", "project", "influenti", "actor", "also", "play", "import", "role", "shape", "project", "promot", "certain", "organis", "strategi", "line", "institut", "logic", "embed", "studi", "conclud", "heterogen", "aaofi", "masb", "shown", "standardis", "strategi", "attribut", "relat", "domin", "certain", "logic", "institut", "context", "central", "logic", "organis", "mission", "goal", "extent", "prevail", "institut", "logic", "repres", "within", "organis", "balanc", "power", "differ", "logic", "repres", "extent", "actor", "abl", "promot", "entrepreneuri", "vision", "mobilis", "alli", "behind"]}, "d9592ee5-a09d-428b-a5a9-83bdbb357043": {"title": "Corporate Governance and Audit Quality: Further Recommendations Beyond the Code", "author_name": "Salem Alhababsah", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/corporate-governance-and-audit-quality-further-recommendations-be", "date": "26 Jan 2018", "data_desc": "Although meeting the recommendations of corporate governance code is important, it is not sufficient to ensure the governance effectiveness (often having more form than substance).

They are: (i) macroeconomic, (ii) business/bank, (iii) market-related, (iv) knowledge economy, (v) external flows and (vi) human development. Results are presented in terms of threshold and non-threshold effects. The former has three main implications. First, there are increasing positive benefits in regulation quality, human development, foreign investment, education, urban population density and internet penetration. Second, there is evidence of decreasing positive effects from patent applications. Third, increasing damaging influences are established for foreign aid and return on equity. Non-threshold tendencies are discussed. Policy implications are also covered with emphasis on policy syndromes to enhance more targeted implications for worst performing nations.", "filtered_title": ["determin", "mobil", "phone", "penetr", "panel", "threshold", "evid", "sub", "saharan", "africa", "simplic", "asongu", "jacinta", "nwachukwu", "aqsa", "aziz", "despit", "evolv", "literatur", "develop", "benefit", "mobil", "phone", "still", "know", "littl", "factor", "influenc", "adopt", "use", "twenti", "five", "polici", "variabl", "investig", "determin", "mobil", "phone", "penetr", "49", "sub", "saharan", "african", "countri", "data", "period", "2000", "2012", "empir", "evid", "base", "contemporari", "non", "contemporari", "ol", "fix", "effect", "system", "gmm", "quantil", "regress", "techniqu", "determin", "classifi", "six", "polici", "categori", "macroeconom", "ii", "busi", "bank", "iii", "market", "relat", "iv", "knowledg", "economi", "v", "extern", "flow", "vi", "human", "develop", "result", "present", "term", "threshold", "non", "threshold", "effect", "former", "three", "main", "implic", "first", "increas", "posit", "benefit", "regul", "qualiti", "human", "develop", "foreign", "invest", "educ", "urban", "popul", "densiti", "internet", "penetr", "second", "evid", "decreas", "posit", "effect", "patent", "applic", "third", "increas", "damag", "influenc", "establish", "foreign", "aid", "return", "equiti", "non", "threshold", "tendenc", "discuss", "polici", "implic", "also", "cover", "emphasi", "polici", "syndrom", "enhanc", "target", "implic", "worst", "perform", "nation"]}, "5ae5fb88-e91b-471a-be9c-fd29af8812c1": {"title": "Does Size Matter in Predicting SMEs Failure?", "author_name": "Jayraj Gupta, Mariachiara Barzotto, Amir Khorasgani", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/does-size-matter-in-predicting-smes-failure", "date": "Oct 2018", "data_desc": "This study acknowledges the diversity between micro, small, and medium\u2010sized firms while predicting bankruptcy and financial distress of the United States small and medium\u2010sized enterprises.

The empirical evidence is based on endogeneity-robust Difference and System Generalised Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, information asymmetry broadly follows the same trend as volatility, with a higher sensitivity to market risk exposure. Second, fund managers tend to raise (cutback) their risk exposure in time of high (low) market liquidity. Third, there is evidence of convergence in equity funds. We may therefore infer that equity funds with lower market risk exposure are catching-up with their counterparts with higher exposure to fluctuation in market conditions.

Many African nations are increasingly embracing this later method because the prevailing Western model has failed to deliver on a number of objectives.

A case study is used herein to articulate the different strands of the survey. The paper puts some structure on China\u2019s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically assessing why it is necessary for the West to modify the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a counterpart to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington Consensus should incorporate those ideas which are in conformity with Moyo\u2019s (2013) conjecture.

(ii) Obtaining a doctorate degree should not simply be reduced to a change in candidate\u2019s title as is often the case with a traditional thesis. (iii) The PhD by Publication is a more effective route to ensuring that the contribution to knowledge is widely disseminated.

Colonisation left behind legacies of institutional framework, social ties and remnants of companies of colonial masters, which could potentially offer contemporary businesses from home countries the benefits of country of origin agglomeration. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses sequential explanatory mixed research design through 101 questionnaires and 8 interviews from the UK companies with FDI in Ghana. This approached enabled the initial quantitative results to be explored further through the qualitative data. Findings: Colonial ties have limited influence on contemporary flow of FDI to Ghana, in spite of the institutional legacies between former colonisers and colonies. Majority of UK companies are influenced by agglomeration opportunities in general rather than country of origin agglomeration. However, country of origin agglomeration remains important to over a third of the companies surveyed. Research limitations/implications: The sample was taken from the non-extractive industry in Ghana, and caution must be applied in generalising the findings. However, some universal issues concerning agglomeration and institutions are discussed. Originality/value: Although there has been some research on colonial history and its impact on FDI in Africa, existing knowledge on bilateral relations is rather limited. Unlike previous studies, this research provides depth by examining colonial influence on FDI between two countries, using two key concepts: country of origin agglomeration and institutions. It provides UK companies with contemporary views to consider when exploring FDI opportunities in Ghana, particularly in relation to the effects of the colonial history. It also provides investment promotion agencies with empirical results on the importance of various forms of agglomeration and institutions for FDI attraction.", "filtered_title": ["pull", "effect", "coloni", "legaci", "africa", "inward", "fdi", "maktoba", "omar", "collin", "osei", "suliman", "joosub", "purpos", "purpos", "paper", "examin", "role", "coloni", "tie", "play", "attract", "foreign", "direct", "invest", "fdi", "ghana", "sever", "year", "offici", "end", "colonis", "african", "contin", "colonis", "left", "behind", "legaci", "institut", "framework", "social", "tie", "remnant", "compani", "coloni", "master", "could", "potenti", "offer", "contemporari", "busi", "home", "countri", "benefit", "countri", "origin", "agglomer", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "paper", "use", "sequenti", "explanatori", "mix", "research", "design", "101", "questionnair", "8", "interview", "uk", "compani", "fdi", "ghana", "approach", "enabl", "initi", "quantit", "result", "explor", "qualit", "data", "find", "coloni", "tie", "limit", "influenc", "contemporari", "flow", "fdi", "ghana", "spite", "institut", "legaci", "former", "colonis", "coloni", "major", "uk", "compani", "influenc", "agglomer", "opportun", "general", "rather", "countri", "origin", "agglomer", "howev", "countri", "origin", "agglomer", "remain", "import", "third", "compani", "survey", "research", "limit", "implic", "sampl", "taken", "non", "extract", "industri", "ghana", "caution", "must", "appli", "generalis", "find", "howev", "univers", "issu", "concern", "agglomer", "institut", "discuss", "origin", "valu", "although", "research", "coloni", "histori", "impact", "fdi", "africa", "exist", "knowledg", "bilater", "relat", "rather", "limit", "unlik", "previous", "studi", "research", "provid", "depth", "examin", "coloni", "influenc", "fdi", "two", "countri", "use", "two", "key", "concept", "countri", "origin", "agglomer", "institut", "provid", "uk", "compani", "contemporari", "view", "consid", "explor", "fdi", "opportun", "ghana", "particular", "relat", "effect", "coloni", "histori", "also", "provid", "invest", "promot", "agenc", "empir", "result", "import", "various", "form", "agglomer", "institut", "fdi", "attract"]}, "204a4158-0bfc-4664-977d-37a73e8878e4": {"title": "Revisiting the evidence of earnings management prior to merger announcements: an application of Benford\u2019s law", "author_name": "Thai Nguyen, Hanh Thi My Le (Editor), Nguyet Nguyen (Editor), Chau Duong (Editor)", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/revisiting-the-evidence-of-earnings-management-prior-to-merger-an", "date": "26 Dec 2018", "data_desc": "The most popularly-used Jones-type models are currently subjected to fierce criticism.

Of particular concern is saline intrusion into productive agricultural land, which is contiguous with densely populated coastal settlements. To reverse saline intrusion in such coastal regions, information about the groundwater depth in terms of its spatio-temporal variability is essential. Using survey data from 2004 to 2007, the research revealed the temporal variation characteristics of groundwater depth in the Contemporary Yellow River Delta. It explored the temporal stability characteristics of groundwater depth by using the coefficient of variation, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and average relative deviation and standard deviation, and confirmed that the representative point reflected the average groundwater depth of the study area. Results showed that spatial variation of the groundwater depth in the study area was medium, but the variation coefficient of groundwater depth showed the seasonal changes. The spatial variation coefficient was largest in the dry season; the other months were relatively stable. The groundwater depth in the study area had strong temporal stability. The correlation between the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and the time lags showed that the spatial pattern of groundwater depth in the study area was similar across two or three years but the similarity weakened beyond this period. The representative points of the whole area showed a good linear correlation, and were spatially concentrated.

Additionally, it is argued that LDCs can avoid the risk of civil conflict by adopting proactive policies to attract FDI.", "filtered_title": ["role", "foreign", "direct", "invest", "less", "develop", "countri", "chengchun", "li", "sailesh", "tanna", "chapter", "analys", "number", "econom", "development", "issu", "less", "develop", "countri", "ldcs", "review", "relat", "literatur", "outlin", "thechalleng", "ahead", "ldcs", "issu", "consid", "includ", "foreign", "direct", "invest", "fdi", "polici", "recent", "trend", "growth", "civil", "conflict", "institut", "develop", "financi", "sector", "develop", "extern", "debt", "macroeconom", "factor", "identifi", "pertin", "area", "ldcs", "face", "major", "challeng", "endeavour", "improv", "econom", "welfar", "sinc", "relat", "absorpt", "capac", "import", "accru", "growth", "benefit", "inward", "fdi", "ldcs", "anticip", "coverag", "issu", "enlighten", "issu", "countri", "face", "order", "attract", "utilis", "inward", "fdi", "addit", "argu", "ldcs", "avoid", "risk", "civil", "conflict", "adopt", "proactiv", "polici", "attract", "fdi"]}, "4461a1b9-8570-4303-878e-22e63797a263": {"title": "The role of seaports in regional employment: evidence from South Korea", "author_name": "Jin Suk Park, Young-Joon Seo", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-role-of-seaports-in-regional-employment-evidence-from-south-k-2", "date": "2018", "data_desc": "This study aims to examine the seaport\u2019s influence on regional employment in all the 16 regions of Korea, including seven metropolitan areas based on panel data between 2002 and 2013.

from behavioural economics suggest that individuals rely on different discount rates to assess the present values of gains and losses (the sign effect). They also suggest that individuals rely on different discount rates to assess investment in financial, environmental and health domains. A first objective is to further consider these valence versus domain effects.   The second, novel, objective is to question whether individuals are likely to employ a higher discount rate for the benefits of investment if they also derive intrinsic value from action. The analysis focuses on perceptions of intrinsic value derived from action to conserve the environment. Will intrinsic motivation increase the sign effect and the difference between the discount rate in different domains? In a questionnaire survey, we collected data from 450 undergraduate students. Participants made choices between hypothetical financial, environmental and health gains and losses that took effect either immediately, or with a delay of 10 years. Results suggest the presence of valence and domain effects and further suggests that intrinsic motivation over action is likely to increase present bias by increasing the sign effect. This dimension of time preference is likely to have an impact on differences between discount rates in different domains.

Land prices influence housing affordability, food security and the carbon infrastructure. Yet price and return histories for farmland in England are fragmented. To provide perspective, a long farmland price series is needed to improve transparency and bring the asset class into line with commercial and residential real estate. After reviewing the historical backdrop and considering methodology, this research uses a chain-linking approach to construct a long-term farmland price series for England. It then adjusts the series for inflation to examine real land prices. The resulting two-century English farmland prices series contributes to farmland market analysis. Notwithstanding some concerns with long-run chain component heterogeneity, the combined series helps us to understand English average farmland price dynamics.

Although all the Islamic banks required complying with the Shari\u2019ah requirements fully, the level of compliance differs among the Islamic banks. At the same time, Islamic banks have been performing well, but all do not demonstrate similar financial performance. This paper aims to explore whether Shari\u2019ah compliance efficiency makes any difference in financial performance of Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL).Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This study used IBBL as a case. For exploring the issue of study, this paper applied an e-mail interview approach and interviewed 24 interviewees including financial analysts, IBBL clients and executives of regulatory bodies, the IBBL and other Islamic- and interest-based traditional banks. Interview opinions are then analyzed and interpreted for a deeper understanding of the topic.Findings \u2013 The study observed that some other factors influence the financial performance of IBBL, but Shari\u2019ah compliance is the dominant instinct of acquiring the leading position. Superior Shari\u2019ah compliance creates internal strengths and external opportunities that facilitate IBBL in achieving higher financial performance. Most interviewees argued that Shari\u2019ah is the only disposition that makes IBBL unique. Moreover, the bank that considerably follows Shari\u2019ah gets better financial outcomes.Research limitations/implications \u2013 The study used a qualitative method using interview responses only for evaluating the relationship between Shari\u2019ah compliance and financial performance. Further study may be conducted based on a quantitative approach.Practical implications \u2013 This paper expects to uphold the significance of Shari\u2019ah in improving the financial performance of IBBL and simultaneously motivating the parties associated with the Islamic banks in enhancing the level of Shari\u2019ah compliance. Moreover, this study provides new insights into the importanceIslamic banks and their performance in relation to the choice of customers.Originality/value \u2013 This study explores the significance of Shari\u2019ah compliance in creating avenues for greater financial performance and develops a model showing the ways how Shari\u2019ah compliance leads Islamic banks to achieve higher financial positions.Keywords Bangladesh, Shari\u2019ah compliance, Financial performance, IBBL, Islamic bank", "filtered_title": ["whether", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "effici", "matter", "financi", "perform", "case", "islami", "bank", "bangladesh", "limit", "hafij", "ullah", "ruma", "khanam", "purpos", "shari", "ah", "foundat", "islam", "bank", "although", "islam", "bank", "requir", "compli", "shari", "ah", "requir", "fulli", "level", "complianc", "differ", "among", "islam", "bank", "time", "islam", "bank", "perform", "well", "demonstr", "similar", "financi", "perform", "paper", "aim", "explor", "whether", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "effici", "make", "differ", "financi", "perform", "islami", "bank", "bangladesh", "limit", "ibbl", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "studi", "use", "ibbl", "case", "explor", "issu", "studi", "paper", "appli", "e", "mail", "interview", "approach", "interview", "24", "interviewe", "includ", "financi", "analyst", "ibbl", "client", "execut", "regulatori", "bodi", "ibbl", "islam", "interest", "base", "tradit", "bank", "interview", "opinion", "analyz", "interpret", "deeper", "understand", "topic", "find", "studi", "observ", "factor", "influenc", "financi", "perform", "ibbl", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "domin", "instinct", "acquir", "lead", "posit", "superior", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "creat", "intern", "strength", "extern", "opportun", "facilit", "ibbl", "achiev", "higher", "financi", "perform", "interviewe", "argu", "shari", "ah", "disposit", "make", "ibbl", "uniqu", "moreov", "bank", "consider", "follow", "shari", "ah", "get", "better", "financi", "outcom", "research", "limit", "implic", "studi", "use", "qualit", "method", "use", "interview", "respons", "evalu", "relationship", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "financi", "perform", "studi", "may", "conduct", "base", "quantit", "approach", "practic", "implic", "paper", "expect", "uphold", "signific", "shari", "ah", "improv", "financi", "perform", "ibbl", "simultan", "motiv", "parti", "associ", "islam", "bank", "enhanc", "level", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "moreov", "studi", "provid", "new", "insight", "importanceislam", "bank", "perform", "relat", "choic", "custom", "origin", "valu", "studi", "explor", "signific", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "creat", "avenu", "greater", "financi", "perform", "develop", "model", "show", "way", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "lead", "islam", "bank", "achiev", "higher", "financi", "posit", "keyword", "bangladesh", "shari", "ah", "complianc", "financi", "perform", "ibbl", "islam", "bank"]}, "116e15da-f6d1-4de8-93b1-92204ab1c31e": {"title": "\u2018Individual Failure\u2019 and a Behavioural Public Sector Economics", "author_name": "Lory Barile, John Cullis, Philip Jones", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/individual-failure-and-a-behavioural-public-sector-economics", "date": "Feb 2018", "data_desc": "", "filtered_title": ["individu", "failur", "behaviour", "public", "sector", "econom", "lori", "baril", "john", "culli", "philip", "jone"]}, "1f7970ac-ac7e-4e78-815c-bfcf7987a2a2": {"title": "Accountability of Transnational Corporations in the Developing World: The Case for an Enforceable International Mechanism", "author_name": "Kamil Omoteso, H.O.

The governance challenges in developing countries with regard to securing the accountability of TNCs is illustrated with the Nigerian experience of oil-industry legislation reform. \n\nFindings: The specific context of the experiences of developing countries in Africa on the operations of TNCs particularly commends the need and expedience to create an international legal regime for ensuring the accountability of TNCs. \n\nOriginality/value: Mainstream research in this area has focused mainly on self and voluntary models of regulation and accountability that have privileged the legal fiction of the corporate status of TNCs.

Environmental pollution arising from corporate operations has been a major concern among transnational organisations (e.g. World Bank, IMF), governments, policymakers and society. Over the past two or more decades, environmental issues have taken on a more significant role in business decisions, corporate planning and global politics (Boutros-Ghali, 1992; Gray et al., 2014). Environmental issues have certainly deserved attention from academia so that research could be undertaken to understand and address the problems (see Freeman, 1984; Strong, 1992; Callan and Thomas, 2000; Darabaris, 2008). There have been various pieces of research on corporate environmental accounting, however their focus has principally been on issues in developed countries (e.g. Buhr and Freedman, 1996; O\u2019Dwyer, 2005; Gray 2010). Developing and emerging economies are in fact creating significant amounts of environmental pollution on a daily basis due to their industrial development (UNEP, 2011; World Bank, 2014; WHO, 2014). Among others, Nigeria has been identified as one such country, with a high level of environmental pollution that contributes significantly to global environmental problems (Adeoti, 2001; UNEP, 2011; Yale, 2012). In the same vein, corporations in Nigeria have been found to be a key contributor for this problem. While corporations should be held accountable for their impacts on the environment, the political, economic and social context in Nigeria have all made corporate environmental accounting a challenge to be achieved. This highlights the need for more research in this area in order to enhance our knowledge on corporate environmental accounting issues in a developing country such as Nigeria, as well as potentially to initiate discussions on how to resolve corporate environmental problems. Most studies in Nigeria have looked at the impacts of environmental issues with no research focused on the management and reporting of environmental issues by corporations in the country and in particular, the cement industry (up to the time when this thesis was written). Therefore, this thesis examined how corporations in particular cement companies have been managing, accounting and reporting environmental issues generated by their operational activities in Nigeria. In order to achieve the purpose of the thesis, it has been necessary to adopt a subjectivity ontology and interpretive epistemology, which entails the use of qualitative perspectives. The study chose a case study approach (two companies were selected to be the case studies) and collected empirical data using a combination of semi-structured interviews, visual techniques and documentary analysis. Unlike most studies in Nigeria that have used the survey questionnaire approach (Owolabi, 2008; Ngwakwe, 2009; Oba et al., 2012; Hassan and Kouhy, 2013), this thesis will provide a more insightful qualitative view on corporate environmental accounting practices in Nigeria. The study also relied on convergent institutional and resource dependence theories as conceptualised by Oliver (1991) to provide a better understanding of CEIs management and reporting in the two chosen cases in particular and Nigeria as whole. The research found that the cement industry was a key environmental polluter in Nigeria, and that companies were under pressure from a number of agents to reduce environmental pollution. It further showed that environmental accountability practices in the Nigerian cement sector are largely influenced by the external institutional environment/factors, and that environmental accountability practices have become more a means of ensuring legitimacy with no significant impact on the wellbeing of citizens and the environment. It also demonstrated that the case studies adopted certain strategies in confronting the challenges from external institutions. Finally, the study contributes to the existing literature on social and environmental accounting research, especially from an emerging countries perspective.

The hypotheses are built on the premise that principles-based standards are more complex than rules-based standards. This study examines the relationships between IFRS complexity, audit fees, and analyst forecast properties. IFRS is likely to require more of auditors in terms of professional expertise, time and effort, hence resulting in higher audit fees. Financial analysts may be similarly affected by the complexity of IFRS resulting in less accurate forecasts on key financial components. This thesis measures IFRS complexity based on individual IFRS standards specifically identified as having higher levels of complexity. Scores are then calculated to indicate the difference between these IFRS standards and their equivalent previous domestic accounting standards. The degree of complexity is also measured at aggregate level to indicate an overall complexity impact based on the combined score for all identified 'complex' IFRS standards. Findings indicate that aggregate IFRS complexity is positively and significantly associated with audit fees but that specific IFRS standards are identifiable as being paiticularly complex, hence explaining much of the positive relationship with audit fees. The results also reveal that the incremental effect of IFRS complexity on audit fees is more pronounced when finns are audited by city-level industly specialists as opposed to those audited by non\u00adindustly specialists. Furthermore, IFRS complexity is found to have a positive and significant association with analyst forecast properties (forecast errors, forecast dispersion, and forecast revision). Surprisingly some of the standards identified as being more complex for auditors (i.e., driving higher audit fees) do not appear similarly complex in relation to financial analyst forecast properties. Finally, this thesis investigates the moderating role of high quality audits (proxied by industry specialist auditors) on complexity and analyst forecast properties and finds that forecast errors decrease for firms which are exposed to higher levels of IFRS complexity if they are audited by city-level industry specialists. This study provides important insights for regulator regarding the complexity of specific IFRS standards. Findings may also be of benefit to countries which are in the process of adopting IFRS or planning to do so.", "filtered_title": ["account", "standard", "complex", "audit", "fee", "financi", "analyst", "forecast", "australia", "muhammad", "shahin", "miah", "benefici", "effect", "intern", "financi", "report", "standard", "ifr", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "cost", "capit", "cross", "countri", "invest", "corpor", "decis", "make", "govern", "well", "studi", "literatur", "relat", "littl", "research", "cost", "side", "ifr", "adopt", "impact", "user", "thesi", "contribut", "investig", "impact", "ifr", "complex", "two", "import", "group", "user", "financi", "report", "name", "auditor", "financi", "analyst", "hypothes", "built", "premis", "principl", "base", "standard", "complex", "rule", "base", "standard", "studi", "examin", "relationship", "ifr", "complex", "audit", "fee", "analyst", "forecast", "properti", "ifr", "like", "requir", "auditor", "term", "profession", "expertis", "time", "effort", "henc", "result", "higher", "audit", "fee", "financi", "analyst", "may", "similar", "affect", "complex", "ifr", "result", "less", "accur", "forecast", "key", "financi", "compon", "thesi", "measur", "ifr", "complex", "base", "individu", "ifr", "standard", "specif", "identifi", "higher", "level", "complex", "score", "calcul", "indic", "differ", "ifr", "standard", "equival", "previous", "domest", "account", "standard", "degre", "complex", "also", "measur", "aggreg", "level", "indic", "overal", "complex", "impact", "base", "combin", "score", "identifi", "complex", "ifr", "standard", "find", "indic", "aggreg", "ifr", "complex", "posit", "signific", "associ", "audit", "fee", "specif", "ifr", "standard", "identifi", "paiticular", "complex", "henc", "explain", "much", "posit", "relationship", "audit", "fee", "result", "also", "reveal", "increment", "effect", "ifr", "complex", "audit", "fee", "pronounc", "finn", "audit", "citi", "level", "indust", "specialist", "oppos", "audit", "non", "indust", "specialist", "furthermor", "ifr", "complex", "found", "posit", "signific", "associ", "analyst", "forecast", "properti", "forecast", "error", "forecast", "dispers", "forecast", "revis", "surpris", "standard", "identifi", "complex", "auditor", "e", "drive", "higher", "audit", "fee", "appear", "similar", "complex", "relat", "financi", "analyst", "forecast", "properti", "final", "thesi", "investig", "moder", "role", "high", "qualiti", "audit", "proxi", "industri", "specialist", "auditor", "complex", "analyst", "forecast", "properti", "find", "forecast", "error", "decreas", "firm", "expos", "higher", "level", "ifr", "complex", "audit", "citi", "level", "industri", "specialist", "studi", "provid", "import", "insight", "regul", "regard", "complex", "specif", "ifr", "standard", "find", "may", "also", "benefit", "countri", "process", "adopt", "ifr", "plan"]}, "0f5e983c-fd83-4e4f-a40f-81ed3ba60989": {"title": "A distance learning university and its economic impact in a country\u2019s peripheries: the case of Hellenic Open University", "author_name": "G.

This paper attempts to quantify the impact of university expenditures on the regionally produced product (GDP). More specifically, we focus on the expenditure effects of the Hellenic Open University on the GDP of the 13 Greek regions. In our analysis we distinguish between direct and indirect effects by identifying as direct effects all initial expenditures incurred by the HOU while we identify and subsequently calculate as indirect effects the increases in local output caused by the interactions of different sectors of the regional economy. For the calculation of indirect effects we use the input\u2013output methodology. An input\u2013output system shows the intermediate transactions between sectors and the primary inputs, as well as, the final demand of each sector. This is a general equilibrium system that records all the inter-sector transactions presenting a complete picture of the economy under examination and being the appropriate system to be used for calculating the total effect of university expenditure on regional GDP. Our results suggest that the economic impact of HOU is (a) significant to the Greek peripheries and its size varies across regions; (b) indirect regional effects boost the direct regional effects by 60 % creating an overall size of the HOU expenses GDP multiplier by 1.6 on average. Moreover, our findings may have two straightforward policy implications that could be useful to those exercising policy making: first, the quantification of HOU economic impact on all Greek peripheries is not only useful for assessing the economic role of HOU at regional level but it could also been seen as a benchmark in assessing the impact of other similar regional educational activities. Secondly, the economic impact of HOU in each periphery can be a useful tool in assessing alternative non-educational, regional projects, aiming to fight the high unemployment arisen due to economic crisis that bedevils Greece and its peripheries in the last 5 years.", "filtered_title": ["distanc", "learn", "univers", "econom", "impact", "countri", "peripheri", "case", "hellen", "open", "univers", "g", "agiomirgianaki", "dimitrio", "sereni", "n", "tsouni", "higher", "educ", "institut", "contribut", "region", "growth", "via", "servic", "teach", "provid", "research", "activ", "develop", "administr", "spillov", "effect", "local", "market", "oper", "paper", "attempt", "quantifi", "impact", "univers", "expenditur", "region", "produc", "product", "gdp", "specif", "focus", "expenditur", "effect", "hellen", "open", "univers", "gdp", "13", "greek", "region", "analysi", "distinguish", "direct", "indirect", "effect", "identifi", "direct", "effect", "initi", "expenditur", "incur", "hou", "identifi", "subsequ", "calcul", "indirect", "effect", "increas", "local", "output", "caus", "interact", "differ", "sector", "region", "economi", "calcul", "indirect", "effect", "use", "input", "output", "methodolog", "input", "output", "system", "show", "intermedi", "transact", "sector", "primari", "input", "well", "final", "demand", "sector", "general", "equilibrium", "system", "record", "inter", "sector", "transact", "present", "complet", "pictur", "economi", "examin", "appropri", "system", "use", "calcul", "total", "effect", "univers", "expenditur", "region", "gdp", "result", "suggest", "econom", "impact", "hou", "signific", "greek", "peripheri", "size", "vari", "across", "region", "b", "indirect", "region", "effect", "boost", "direct", "region", "effect", "60", "creat", "overal", "size", "hou", "expens", "gdp", "multipli", "1", "6", "averag", "moreov", "find", "may", "two", "straightforward", "polici", "implic", "could", "use", "exercis", "polici", "make", "first", "quantif", "hou", "econom", "impact", "greek", "peripheri", "use", "assess", "econom", "role", "hou", "region", "level", "could", "also", "seen", "benchmark", "assess", "impact", "similar", "region", "educ", "activ", "second", "econom", "impact", "hou", "peripheri", "use", "tool", "assess", "altern", "non", "educ", "region", "project", "aim", "fight", "high", "unemploy", "arisen", "due", "econom", "crisi", "bedevil", "greec", "peripheri", "last", "5", "year"]}, "868aca6c-59b6-4a45-a05d-3cc0088f75bd": {"title": "Aggregate and Disaggregate Financial Repression and Financial Liberalization Index and Database in China", "author_name": "Qiaoyuan Lin, Xin Wu, Ali Tasiran", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/aggregate-and-disaggregate-financial-repression-and-financial-lib", "date": "2017", "data_desc": "This research project is to construct aggregate and disaggregate measures of financial repression and financial liberalisation at aggregate and disaggregate levels in China.

We employed contemporary and non-contemporary interactive quantile regressions in 53 African countries for the period 2004-2011. Information-sharing bureaus are proxied with public credit registries and private credit offices. Financial development dynamics involving depth (at overall economic and financial system levels), efficiency (at banking and financial system levels), activity (from banking and financial system perspectives), and size are used. Two key findings are established. First, the effect of an increase in private credit bureaus is not clearly noticeable on financial access, probably because private credit agencies are still to be established in many countries. Second, an increase in public credit registries for the most part improves financial allocation efficiency and activity (or credit) between the 25th and 75th quartiles. As a main policy implication, countries in the top and bottom ends of the financial efficiency and activity distributions are unlikely to benefit from enhanced financial allocation efficiency as a result of an increase in public credit registries.Publisher Statement: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.", "filtered_title": ["level", "financi", "develop", "inform", "share", "matter", "simplic", "asongu", "jacinta", "nwachukwu", "purpos", "studi", "investig", "increas", "inform", "share", "bureaus", "affect", "financi", "access", "employ", "contemporari", "non", "contemporari", "interact", "quantil", "regress", "53", "african", "countri", "period", "2004", "2011", "inform", "share", "bureaus", "proxi", "public", "credit", "registri", "privat", "credit", "offic", "financi", "develop", "dynam", "involv", "depth", "overal", "econom", "financi", "system", "level", "effici", "bank", "financi", "system", "level", "activ", "bank", "financi", "system", "perspect", "size", "use", "two", "key", "find", "establish", "first", "effect", "increas", "privat", "credit", "bureaus", "clear", "notic", "financi", "access", "probabl", "privat", "credit", "agenc", "still", "establish", "mani", "countri", "second", "increas", "public", "credit", "registri", "part", "improv", "financi", "alloc", "effici", "activ", "credit", "25th", "75th", "quartil", "main", "polici", "implic", "countri", "top", "bottom", "end", "financi", "effici", "activ", "distribut", "unlik", "benefit", "enhanc", "financi", "alloc", "effici", "result", "increas", "public", "credit", "registri", "publish", "statement", "articl", "distribut", "term", "creativ", "common", "attribut", "4", "0", "intern", "licens", "http", "creativecommon", "org", "licens", "4", "0", "permit", "unrestrict", "use", "distribut", "reproduct", "medium", "provid", "give", "appropri", "credit", "origin", "author", "sourc", "provid", "link", "creativ", "common", "licens", "indic", "chang", "made"]}, "b8ae4744-8992-46b9-b3cb-a7857c9cb409": {"title": "Audit firm tenure regulations and financial reporting quality: Evidence from the UK", "author_name": "Shahidul Islam", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/audit-firm-tenure-regulations-and-financial-reporting-quality-evi", "date": "2017", "data_desc": "", "filtered_title": ["audit", "firm", "tenur", "regul", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "evid", "uk", "shahidul", "islam"]}, "55989a27-f4f3-4a0c-b0f6-b82c76529d58": {"title": "Beliefs, Portfolio Constraints, Speculation and Asset Pricing", "author_name": "Nam Dau", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/beliefs-portfolio-constraints-speculation-and-asset-pricing", "date": "2017", "data_desc": "", "filtered_title": ["belief", "portfolio", "constraint", "specul", "asset", "price", "nam", "dau"]}, "36896034-9ea6-4178-a8ce-4f310be1d513": {"title": "BIM-based deconstruction tool: Towards essential functionalities", "author_name": "O.O.

To understand how BIM could be employed for DfD and to identify essential functionalities for a BIM-based deconstruction tool, Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted with professionals who have utilised BIM on their projects. The interview transcripts of the FGIs were analysed using descriptive interpretive analysis to identify common themes based on the experiences of the participants. The themes highlight functionalities of BIM in driving effective DfD process, which include improved collaboration among stakeholders, visualisation of deconstruction process, identification of recoverable materials, deconstruction plan development, performance analysis and simulation of end-of-life alternatives, improved building lifecycle management, and interoperability with existing BIM software. The results provide the needed technological support for developing tools for BIM compliant DfD tools.\n\n", "filtered_title": ["bim", "base", "deconstruct", "tool", "toward", "essenti", "function", "akinad", "l", "oyedel", "kamil", "omoteso", "ajayi", "bilal", "h", "owolabi", "h", "alaka", "l", "ayri", "j", "h", "looney", "studi", "discuss", "futur", "direct", "effect", "design", "deconstruct", "dfd", "use", "bim", "base", "approach", "design", "coordin", "review", "extant", "literatur", "exist", "dfd", "practic", "tool", "becam", "evid", "none", "tool", "bim", "compliant", "bim", "implement", "ignor", "end", "life", "activ", "understand", "bim", "could", "employ", "dfd", "identifi", "essenti", "function", "bim", "base", "deconstruct", "tool", "focus", "group", "interview", "fgis", "conduct", "profession", "utilis", "bim", "project", "interview", "transcript", "fgis", "analys", "use", "descript", "interpret", "analysi", "identifi", "common", "theme", "base", "experi", "particip", "theme", "highlight", "function", "bim", "drive", "effect", "dfd", "process", "includ", "improv", "collabor", "among", "stakehold", "visualis", "deconstruct", "process", "identif", "recover", "materi", "deconstruct", "plan", "develop", "perform", "analysi", "simul", "end", "life", "altern", "improv", "build", "lifecycl", "manag", "interoper", "exist", "bim", "softwar", "result", "provid", "need", "technolog", "support", "develop", "tool", "bim", "compliant", "dfd", "tool"]}, "c1b820f5-7de9-4803-9c70-85e6c6ecd4c3": {"title": "Buying Friends?

First, a basic Ohlson model where our results indicate that while the value relevance of the book values of equity has declined, it has been replaced by the increasing prominence of earnings in both Germany and the UK after the switch to the IFRS. Second, a modified model, which shows that the incremental value relevance of both earnings and book values are considerably higher in the long term for firms in the UK than in Germany. Third, a simultaneous addition of accounting and macroeconomic variables in an extended model, revealed a significant rise in the relative predictive power of the book value of equity in the UK compared with the more noticeable impact on the value relevance of earnings in Germany. Further, our results show a statistically significant negative coefficient on the lagged error correction term indicates that a long-run Granger-causal relationship exists between our accounting variables and share prices in the UK. Collectively, the explanatory power of our three equity valuation models is lower in Germany than in the UK, reflecting the former country\u2019s conservative financial reporting system.

The extant literature shows that environmental problems and the scale of consequences vary across developing and developed countries (Yale, 2005). A major issue within emerging economies has been the controlling of emissions, the rise of which has become unprecedented as the economies of these countries continue to expand. Prior work in Nigeria has illustrated a high rate of environmental pollutions led to by the expansion of oil extraction and other industrial activities (Hassan and Kouhy, 2013).  In the last few years, the country has undertaken various initiatives, including the implementation of the Kyoto protocol, as part of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. The extant literature has covered the impacts of such initiatives in the oil and energy sector (Hassan and Kouhy, 2013). However, the environmental impacts of other industries and the ways these industries are discharging their accountability have remained under-researched. The study adds to the literature by investigating how the cement industry - the second largest contributor to the socio-economic growth and development of Nigeria, (Mojekwu, 2013) - has been discharging its corporate and environmental accountability. Drawing on institutional theory, the study unfolds the types of strategies that Nigerian cement companies have adopted to report their carbon emissions and discharge environmental accountability.

Using a constant-mean-return event study, we show that these events are associated with positive and significant abnormal returns on oil and bonds, which means that these two asset classes can potentially shelter shareholders from plummeting equity values during international crises. A formal safe haven analysis confirms this insight. Such price movements may reflect a reallocation of funds across asset classes in response to the events, as well as shifts in the demand for oil due to precautionary, speculative and military motives. We also calculate the weights for optimal portfolios, which could provide insurance against conflict risk.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Energy Economics.

This paper aims to (a) derive the influencing factors of a tourism demand function and (b) identify the time impact of these factors, thus, allowing the formulations of effective policy actions, by both, governmental tourism authorities and private tourism agents in Singapore. Our findings suggest that tourism government authorities and private tourism agents in Singapore should choose the timing of their actions depending upon the anticipated factor changes and their estimated impact. That is, if exchange rate variability is anticipated then policy actions should start at least twelve months prior to the start of the tourist period. If, a keen price competition is expected to prevail then the best timing of policy actions is nine months ahead the tourism period.

The current study also found other motivations behind management fraud that could be more specific to the Egyptian context.Research limitations/implicationsGaining access to small- and medium-size audit firms, in particular, was very difficult.

The empirical evidence is based on an updated sample of 53 African countries for the period 2005\u20132012.ResultsThe following findings are established. First, the impacts of aid dynamics with high degrees of substitution are positive. These include aid for: social infrastructure, economic infrastructure, the productive sector, and multisectors. Second, the effect of humanitarian assistance is consistently negative across specifications and models. Third, the effects of program assistance and action on debt are ambiguous because they become positive with the GMM technique.ConclusionsJustifications for these changes and clarifications with respect to existing literature are provided.

Interactive quantile regressions are used. Findings -   First, with the exception of unclear terrorism, bilateral aid can be used to mitigate the potentially negative effect of terrorism on fuel exports in bottom quintiles of the fuel export distribution. Second, multilateral aid can be used to reduce the negative effect of transnational terrorism on fuel exports exclusively in the highest (90th) quintile of fuel exports.  The corresponding modifying thresholds are within policy ranges disclosed in the summary statistics.  Practical implications- While the policy instrument of bilateral aid is most relevant in countries with below-median fuel exports, the policy instrument of multilateral aid is effective with respect to transnational terrorism in countries with the highest levels of fuel exports.Originality/value \u2013This study contributes to the literature on the role of external flows in reducing the negative externalities of terrorism on development outcomes.

We build a Markov regime switching (MRS) model where hedging and speculative pressures affect the transition probabilities between a stronger and weaker spot-futures relationship. It is found that hedging pressure increases the likelihood of transition, i.e. destabilises the existing spot-futures relationship, while speculative pressure reduces it, i.e. stabilises the relationship, in the copper, crude oil and natural gas markets, but this effect is relatively weak in the silver and heating oil markets. We also examine whether these findings generate practical benefits by testing the hedging effectiveness of the minimum variance hedge ratios (MVH) derived from the MRS models with hedging and speculative pressures. A relatively strong reduction of the portfolio variance, hedger's utility and value at risk (VaR) is observed in the energy markets.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in International Review of Financial Analysis.

Second, volatility (measured by the variance) screens periods of atypical fluctuations in the series. Finally, the series is regressed against its past values to assess the level of persistence. The sequential steps screen the length of the cycles in UK commercial property market to facilitate interpretation.

Our findings show that, while foreign aid does not have a significant effect on political rights, foreign aid volatilities do mitigate democracy in recipient countries. Such volatilities could be used by populist parties to promote a neocolonial agenda, instill nationalistic sentiments, and consolidate their grip on power. This is especially true when donors are asking for standards that the majority of the population in control does not want and political leaders are unwilling to implement them.

The research problem driving this study is the accounting professionals\u2019 deviant decision-making behaviour due to conflict of interests. Extant literature suggests that the prevalence of said problem is attributable to the ineffective management of conflicting interests \u2013 the existing procedures do not account, sufficiently, for the accounting professionals\u2019 independence in fact. This research builds, primarily, on the work of Moore, Tanlu and Bazerman (2010) and Guiral, Rodgers, Ruiz and Gonzalo (2010). Although they attempted to address the professionals\u2019 independence in fact by examining the psychological and cognitive impacts of conflict of interests, there still is a lack of understanding about the interaction of conflict of interests with decision-making. Consequently, there have been repeated calls for more research to understand how conflict of interests operates at the level of an individual accounting professional. Accordingly, this study is aimed at examining the process through which conflict of interests affects accounting professionals\u2019 decision-making behaviour. To achieve this aim, a cognitive approach has been developed through integration of social cognitive theory and throughput model of decision-making. This research adopts a quantitative approach to investigation and the data have been collected by conducting a quasi-experiment with 105 professionals from the Big Four accounting firms in the UK. Likert-type items/scales are used to record data as the professionals\u2019 self-reports on their perceptions and behaviour. Partial Least Squares-Path Analysis has been implemented for data analysis and hypotheses testing. Following the post-positivists stance, the concern is \u2018failure to reject\u2019 a hypothesis rather than \u2018proving\u2019 it. The empirical results provide that the professionals\u2019 positive outcome expectancy of compliant decision-making (POE), perceived difficulty in making compliant decisions (PD) and ethical judgements (EJ) play mediating role in the relationship between conflict of interests (CoI) and the likelihood of deviant decision-making behaviour (DD). The low POE, high PD and less EJ are evidenced to be the situational cognitive predictors and the high propensity to morally disengage (PMD) the dispositional cognitive predictor of DD. Decision-making behaviour is evidenced to be prone to bias due to the significant role of POE and PD in the decision-making process. These results suggest that the process through which CoI affects accounting professionals\u2019 decision-making behaviour is governed through the agency of their POE, PD and EJ. During this process, CoI plays biasing role and due to which the deviations from compliant behaviour might occur even undesirably. Therefore, DD is high in case of the professionals who perceive the negative outcomes of compliant decision-making to outweigh its positive outcomes, perceive high difficulty in making the given compliant decision, form a judgement that deviant decision choice is the most ethical and have high propensity of considering unethical behaviour as acceptable. Thus, in the events of conflict of interests, the likelihood of deviant behaviour can be reduced through encouraging amongst professionals the high POE, low PD, high EJ and low PMD. This study holds significance since it provides the much-needed empirical evidence for the role of accounting professionals\u2019 cognitive processes in the relationship between conflict of interests and their decision-making behaviour. The cognitive approach adopted in this study provides a novel perspective for investigating the decision-making process. Moreover, the robust experiment employed for data collection adds to the extant research that lacks in experimental scenarios for addressing conflict of interests. Since all the insights revealed by this study\u2019s results are relevant to the professionals\u2019 state of mind, these insights can be combined to strengthen their independence in fact \u2013 to this end, I have proposed a behavioural framework to complement the accounting firms\u2019 current efforts for managing conflict of interests. On a practical level, the professional accounting firms, the accounting professionals, the regulators and the other relevant professions can use this study\u2019s findings and the new knowledge for making better decisions and to improve their policies.", "filtered_title": ["manag", "conflict", "interest", "profession", "account", "firm", "maria", "ishaqu", "studi", "view", "conflict", "interest", "profession", "account", "firm", "len", "behaviour", "risk", "manag", "research", "problem", "drive", "studi", "account", "profession", "deviant", "decis", "make", "behaviour", "due", "conflict", "interest", "extant", "literatur", "suggest", "preval", "said", "problem", "attribut", "ineffect", "manag", "conflict", "interest", "exist", "procedur", "account", "suffici", "account", "profession", "independ", "fact", "research", "build", "primarili", "work", "moor", "tanlu", "bazerman", "2010", "guiral", "rodger", "ruiz", "gonzalo", "2010", "although", "attempt", "address", "profession", "independ", "fact", "examin", "psycholog", "cognit", "impact", "conflict", "interest", "still", "lack", "understand", "interact", "conflict", "interest", "decis", "make", "consequ", "repeat", "call", "research", "understand", "conflict", "interest", "oper", "level", "individu", "account", "profession", "accord", "studi", "aim", "examin", "process", "conflict", "interest", "affect", "account", "profession", "decis", "make", "behaviour", "achiev", "aim", "cognit", "approach", "develop", "integr", "social", "cognit", "theori", "throughput", "model", "decis", "make", "research", "adopt", "quantit", "approach", "investig", "data", "collect", "conduct", "quasi", "experi", "105", "profession", "big", "four", "account", "firm", "uk", "likert", "type", "item", "scale", "use", "record", "data", "profession", "self", "report", "percept", "behaviour", "partial", "least", "squar", "path", "analysi", "implement", "data", "analysi", "hypothes", "test", "follow", "post", "positivist", "stanc", "concern", "failur", "reject", "hypothesi", "rather", "prove", "empir", "result", "provid", "profession", "posit", "outcom", "expect", "compliant", "decis", "make", "poe", "perceiv", "difficulti", "make", "compliant", "decis", "pd", "ethic", "judgement", "ej", "play", "mediat", "role", "relationship", "conflict", "interest", "coi", "likelihood", "deviant", "decis", "make", "behaviour", "dd", "low", "poe", "high", "pd", "less", "ej", "evidenc", "situat", "cognit", "predictor", "high", "propens", "moral", "disengag", "pmd", "disposit", "cognit", "predictor", "dd", "decis", "make", "behaviour", "evidenc", "prone", "bias", "due", "signific", "role", "poe", "pd", "decis", "make", "process", "result", "suggest", "process", "coi", "affect", "account", "profession", "decis", "make", "behaviour", "govern", "agenc", "poe", "pd", "ej", "process", "coi", "play", "bias", "role", "due", "deviat", "compliant", "behaviour", "might", "occur", "even", "undesir", "therefor", "dd", "high", "case", "profession", "perceiv", "negat", "outcom", "compliant", "decis", "make", "outweigh", "posit", "outcom", "perceiv", "high", "difficulti", "make", "given", "compliant", "decis", "form", "judgement", "deviant", "decis", "choic", "ethic", "high", "propens", "consid", "uneth", "behaviour", "accept", "thus", "event", "conflict", "interest", "likelihood", "deviant", "behaviour", "reduc", "encourag", "amongst", "profession", "high", "poe", "low", "pd", "high", "ej", "low", "pmd", "studi", "hold", "signific", "sinc", "provid", "much", "need", "empir", "evid", "role", "account", "profession", "cognit", "process", "relationship", "conflict", "interest", "decis", "make", "behaviour", "cognit", "approach", "adopt", "studi", "provid", "novel", "perspect", "investig", "decis", "make", "process", "moreov", "robust", "experi", "employ", "data", "collect", "add", "extant", "research", "lack", "experiment", "scenario", "address", "conflict", "interest", "sinc", "insight", "reveal", "studi", "result", "relev", "profession", "state", "mind", "insight", "combin", "strengthen", "independ", "fact", "end", "propos", "behaviour", "framework", "complement", "account", "firm", "current", "effort", "manag", "conflict", "interest", "practic", "level", "profession", "account", "firm", "account", "profession", "regul", "relev", "profess", "use", "studi", "find", "new", "knowledg", "make", "better", "decis", "improv", "polici"]}, "83c09e2f-cb48-4c77-9020-d55a297d749b": {"title": "Megaproject Screening and Management: King\u2019s Cross, Olympic Park and Nine Elms", "author_name": "Reyhaneh Rahimzad, Simon Huston, Ali Parsa", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/megaproject-screening-and-management-kings-cross-olympic-park-and", "date": "14 Sep 2017", "data_desc": "Urban megaprojects are complex, unique and, almost invariably, contentious.

Notwithstanding controversy, macroeconomic turbulence, policy flux, project complexity and practical difficulties vary in diverse architectural, urban design, institutional and geographic settings.

Ordinary least square models are also used to examine how ownership variables affect offer price discounts and stock market performance during the announcement of such corporate events.FindingsThe authors show that placings and open offers (OOs) are the preferred methods for issuing equity by firms with higher managerial ownership. Thus, the evidence strongly supports the prediction of the entrenched management hypothesis. Moreover, the probability of choosing a combination of placings and OOs is also found to be significantly related to issue size, offer discount, leverage, and previous stock performance. The results show that pre-issue market conditions have a significant effect on the choice of issue method with rights offers (ROs) and the combination of placings and OOs primarily utilised by firms for issuing equity during hot market periods.Originality/valueUnlike prior SEOs\u2019 studies in the UK that predominantly concentrate on the use of ROs and placings, this study examines, for the first time, the link between OOs and the combination of placings and OOs with ownership concentration.

Even though the technology has been available for more than a decade, mobile payment has been adopted into widespread usage only in some countries, including Japan, South Korea, Kenya and the Philippines. Nonetheless, other parts of the world appear to be catching up fast and it is important for both public and private sectors to understand the determinants of mobile payment adoption. This study investigates the drivers of mobile payment adoption in the past decade through comparative studies of both developed and developing countries. Conceptual frameworks, including the network effects and broadband ecosystem, are also applied to support the analysis offered in this paper. Moreover, this study explores the similarities and differences between the above mentioned countries and why they have been more successful in adopting the mobile payment technology compared to other states, such as the US and European countries.The key finding is that a successful and widespread adoption of mobile payment requiresstrongly growing demand and ready availability of infrastructure and technology on the supply side. The rapidly growing popularity of smartphones fueled the demand side by making the new payment technology reachable by large groups of consumers. Nevertheless, the use of mobile payment could not be significantly increased without an introduction of killer applications in each country or region. This is where the regulators in both financial and telecommunication sectors play a crucial role. A good combination of regulation and/or policy on the supply and demand sides is a way forward.

This study examines the distribution of total expenditure-to-income by homeownership status at the end of the recent recession in 2010. Multivariate quantile regressions uncover four important points. First, owner-occupiers in England have considerably higher mean spending ratios than their peers in other parts of the UK; an indication of their wealthier status. Second, the average spending ratio for residential-occupiers in all UK regions, with the exception of Northern Ireland, is significantly higher than the mean ratio for tenants in both private and public properties. In this last region, the spending rate for private tenants is more prominent. Third, the disparity in the expenditure ratio between owner-occupiers and tenants is significantly more pronounced in England. Fourth, renters in public housing in Scotland and Wales have much higher spending ratios than their counterparts in private properties, reflecting a greater overall social security provided by the devolved government there. Policy implications allied with heterogeneity in the consumption effect of housing wealth across the different homeownership cohorts is discussed.Publisher Statement: The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-016-1409-z  ", "filtered_title": ["tenur", "spend", "within", "uk", "household", "end", "recent", "recess", "jacinta", "c", "nwachukwu", "hous", "cost", "form", "substanti", "share", "aggreg", "demand", "uk", "studi", "examin", "distribut", "total", "expenditur", "incom", "homeownership", "status", "end", "recent", "recess", "2010", "multivari", "quantil", "regress", "uncov", "four", "import", "point", "first", "owner", "occupi", "england", "consider", "higher", "mean", "spend", "ratio", "peer", "part", "uk", "indic", "wealthier", "status", "second", "averag", "spend", "ratio", "residenti", "occupi", "uk", "region", "except", "northern", "ireland", "signific", "higher", "mean", "ratio", "tenant", "privat", "public", "properti", "last", "region", "spend", "rate", "privat", "tenant", "promin", "third", "dispar", "expenditur", "ratio", "owner", "occupi", "tenant", "signific", "pronounc", "england", "fourth", "renter", "public", "hous", "scotland", "wale", "much", "higher", "spend", "ratio", "counterpart", "privat", "properti", "reflect", "greater", "overal", "social", "secur", "provid", "devolv", "govern", "polici", "implic", "alli", "heterogen", "consumpt", "effect", "hous", "wealth", "across", "differ", "homeownership", "cohort", "discuss", "publish", "statement", "final", "public", "avail", "springer", "via", "http", "dx", "doi", "org", "10", "1007", "s11205", "016", "1409", "z"]}, "a33dd60d-02a8-4350-bdcf-102a3c40aab7": {"title": "The effects of Foreign Ownership and Chinese firms\u2019 Earnings Management: Accrual-based and Real activity-based", "author_name": "Prabhu Udawatte, Sang Ho Kim, Yohan  An", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effects-of-foreign-ownership-and-chinese-firms-earnings-manag", "date": "2017", "data_desc": "", "filtered_title": ["effect", "foreign", "ownership", "chines", "firm", "earn", "manag", "accrual", "base", "real", "activ", "base", "prabhu", "udawatt", "sang", "ho", "kim", "yohan"]}, "02ff8a8f-24df-4c15-9fc2-01fbc77bc803": {"title": "The impact of civil war on foreign direct investment flows to developing countries", "author_name": "Chengchun Li, Syed Mansoob Murshed, Sailesh Tanna", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-impact-of-civil-war-on-foreign-direct-investment-flows-to-dev-2", "date": "2017", "data_desc": "We investigate the impact of civil war on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to developing countries.

In 2003, the Ghanaian listed firms adopted the Ghanaian Corporate Governance Code on comply or explain basis but no study to date has analysed the pre-2003 and post-2003 board structure changes impact on firm performance in the Ghanaian environment. We predict that board structure changes prompted by the introduction of the Ghanaian Code in 2003 should lead to better firm performance. Using a panel regression model, our results show that duality decreases firm performance pre-2003, but those firms that separate the two posts in line with the recommendations of the Ghanaian Code did not perform better than those that combined the two post-2003. While we find no relationship between board committees and firm performance pre-2003, the relationship switched to positive and statistically significant post-2003. The most consistent result we find concerns board size. However, the non-executive director representation on the board appears to have no impact on firm performance. These results show that not all board structure recommendations introduced by the Ghanaian Code are effective in achieving superior performance in Ghana.Publisher Statement: This paper is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International License (CC BY-NC 4.0) (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)", "filtered_title": ["perform", "consequ", "board", "structur", "chang", "evid", "ghana", "andrew", "owusu", "mark", "holm", "jacob", "agyemang", "paper", "analys", "perform", "consequ", "board", "structur", "chang", "ghana", "studi", "period", "2000", "2009", "2003", "ghanaian", "list", "firm", "adopt", "ghanaian", "corpor", "govern", "code", "compli", "explain", "basi", "studi", "date", "analys", "pre", "2003", "post", "2003", "board", "structur", "chang", "impact", "firm", "perform", "ghanaian", "environ", "predict", "board", "structur", "chang", "prompt", "introduct", "ghanaian", "code", "2003", "lead", "better", "firm", "perform", "use", "panel", "regress", "model", "result", "show", "dualiti", "decreas", "firm", "perform", "pre", "2003", "firm", "separ", "two", "post", "line", "recommend", "ghanaian", "code", "perform", "better", "combin", "two", "post", "2003", "find", "relationship", "board", "committe", "firm", "perform", "pre", "2003", "relationship", "switch", "posit", "statist", "signific", "post", "2003", "consist", "result", "find", "concern", "board", "size", "howev", "non", "execut", "director", "represent", "board", "appear", "impact", "firm", "perform", "result", "show", "board", "structur", "recommend", "introduc", "ghanaian", "code", "effect", "achiev", "superior", "perform", "ghana", "publish", "statement", "paper", "licens", "creativ", "common", "attribut", "intern", "licens", "cc", "nc", "4", "0", "https", "creativecommon", "org", "licens", "nc", "4", "0"]}, "0b72a3b3-5bf1-4408-a92e-f2b47756fcaa": {"title": "The stability of money demand in the long-run: Italy 1861\u20132011", "author_name": "Vittorio Daniele, Pasquale Foresti, Oreste Napolitano", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-stability-of-money-demand-in-the-long-run-italy-18612011", "date": "May 2017", "data_desc": "Money demand stability is a crucial issue for monetary policy efficacy, and it is particularly endangered when substantial changes occur in the monetary system.

Its purpose is to model the future of scientific knowledge monopoly in order to understand whether the impressive growth experienced by latecomers in the industry has been accompanied by a similar catch-up in scientific capabilities and knowledge contribution. The empirical evidence for the period 1994\u20132010 is based on 41 panels which together consist of 99 countries. The large dataset allows us to disaggregate countries into fundamental characteristics based on income levels (high-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and low-income), legal origins (English common-law, French civil-law, German civil-law and Scandinavian civil-law) and regional proximity (South Asia, Europe and Central Asia; East Asia and the Pacific; Middle East and North Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa).

The study also sheds light on the root causes for auditors\u2019 bias in fraud risk assessment and proposes an alternative fraud triangle model that could be more suitable for audit professionals in the assessment of financial reporting fraud risk. The proposed auditors\u2019 fraud triangle model was designed after careful consideration of external auditors\u2019 views on what matters in the assessment of financial reporting fraud risk. While the traditional fraud triangle model assumes that all fraud factors have the same importance, the auditors in this study perceived management motivations as the most important fraud factor because management motivations are key antecedents to fraud. They also believe that management integrity comes second in terms of importance and that rationalisation of fraud should be viewed as a red flag for low management integrity rather than a separate fraud factor. The traditional fraud triangle did not include fraud perpetrators\u2019 capabilities while the auditors in this study believe that not every person is capable of exploiting existing opportunities for fraud and therefore auditors need to consider fraud perpetrators\u2019 capabilities in the assessment of fraud risk. From the auditors\u2019 perspective, power in the organisation, knowledge of the accounting system, and good understanding of internal control weaknesses are the main traits that enhance perpetrators\u2019 capabilities to commit financial reporting fraud. This study has implications for auditors and audit regulators, and suggest new directions for future research.

To establish whether the impact of financial openness on both bank risk and profit efficiency occurs directly or through each one of the two bank characteristics (efficiency and risk, respectively), we begin our analysis by investigating the potential reverse Granger causality between profit efficiency and risk using a dynamic simultaneous model via system GMM estimation. We then account explicitly for the role of bank risk in the estimation of bank profit efficiency using stochastic frontier analysis, allowing for the influence of different measures of financial openness and risk alongside other control variables. Our results indicate that financial openness reduces bank profit efficiency directly, not through changes in bank risk. We also find that financial openness increases bank risk indirectly, through the decreased bank profit efficiency channel.NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Journal of Financial Stability.

This paper investigates and reveals the multi-facets of ICT productivity and the mechanism through which ICT affects productivity by bringing all the distinct streams of existing findings together. In particular, we develop a two-level frontier-efficiency model to examine how ICT's direct and indirect impact on different components of productivity is related to the economic growth in the US. Our empirical analysis has confirmed that ICT investment does contribute to productivity but not in the usual manner \u2013 we find a positive (but lagged) ICT effect on technological progress. We argue that for a positive ICT role on growth to actually take place, a period of negative relationship between productivity and ICT investment together with ICT-using sectors\u2019 capacity to learn from the embodied new technology was crucial. In addition, it took a learning period with appropriate complementary co-inventions for the new ICT-capital to become effective and its gains to be realized. Our findings provide solid, further empirical evidence to support ICT as a general purpose technology.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Information Economics and Policy.

The empirical evidence is based on interactive generalised methods of moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The following findings are established. First, PCRs and PCBs have negative effects on financial depth, with the magnitude of the former higher. Second, contrary to PCRs which have insignificant effects, PCBs have a negative impact on banking system efficiency. Third, PCRs and PCBs have negative impacts on financial activity, with the magnitude of the latter higher. Moreover, both of their marginal effects are negative. Fourth, PCRs and PCBs have positive effects on financial size, with the effect of the former higher. While marginal effects are positive, corresponding thresholds are not within range.

The adoption status is then regressed on a number of variables of interest. To establish that our results are robust, we used a combination of different regression techniques comprising OLS, multinomial and logistic regressions.\nFindings- In addition to GDP growth and education level, this paper adds new evidence to the literature by reporting the positive association between the level of democracy and the enforcement of securities\u2019 regulation on ISA adoption. It argues that political, economic, social and legal factors impact on ISA adoption in the IFSCs.\nResearch limitations/implications- The sample size is limited to 50 from a population of 99 IFSCs because of lack of data. Some of the independent variables are basically archival data. Reliance is placed on WEF with regard to the measurement of protection of minority interest, securities and exchange regulations, and on Economic Intelligence Unit for democracy index.\nPractical implications- This paper stresses the importance of ISAs in IFSCs and the role of political power and the enforcement of securities laws on the adoption of ISA.\nOriginality/value-This study fills the research gap relating to the absence of empirical studies on ISA adoption and its drivers in IFSCs.\n\n", "filtered_title": ["intern", "standard", "audit", "intern", "financi", "servic", "centr", "matter", "pran", "boolaki", "kamil", "omoteso", "purpos", "paper", "aim", "1", "investig", "posit", "intern", "financi", "servic", "centr", "ifsc", "intern", "feder", "account", "countri", "status", "intern", "standard", "audit", "adopt", "2", "assess", "factor", "influenc", "isa", "adopt", "centr", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "research", "drew", "data", "various", "sourc", "includ", "world", "econom", "forum", "dataset", "world", "bank", "report", "observ", "standard", "code", "world", "develop", "indic", "econom", "intellig", "unit", "report", "democraci", "index", "fifti", "countri", "classifi", "ifsc", "adopt", "status", "regress", "number", "variabl", "interest", "establish", "result", "robust", "use", "combin", "differ", "regress", "techniqu", "compris", "ol", "multinomi", "logist", "regress", "find", "addit", "gdp", "growth", "educ", "level", "paper", "add", "new", "evid", "literatur", "report", "posit", "associ", "level", "democraci", "enforc", "secur", "regul", "isa", "adopt", "argu", "polit", "econom", "social", "legal", "factor", "impact", "isa", "adopt", "ifsc", "research", "limit", "implic", "sampl", "size", "limit", "50", "popul", "99", "ifsc", "lack", "data", "independ", "variabl", "basic", "archiv", "data", "relianc", "place", "wef", "regard", "measur", "protect", "minor", "interest", "secur", "exchang", "regul", "econom", "intellig", "unit", "democraci", "index", "practic", "implic", "paper", "stress", "import", "isa", "ifsc", "role", "polit", "power", "enforc", "secur", "law", "adopt", "isa", "origin", "valu", "studi", "fill", "research", "gap", "relat", "absenc", "empir", "studi", "isa", "adopt", "driver", "ifsc"]}, "ccc66dad-fdc7-45d3-8fc4-c8aff06efa77": {"title": "Islamic financial reporting standardisation projects: institutional logics perspective on the Malaysian case", "author_name": "Ahmad Abras", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/islamic-financial-reporting-standardisation-projects-institutiona", "date": "2016", "data_desc": "", "filtered_title": ["islam", "financi", "report", "standardis", "project", "institut", "logic", "perspect", "malaysian", "case", "ahmad", "abra"]}, "afaeb14d-d213-4d0d-84de-cec048ba1e2c": {"title": "Is there a Mission Drift in Microfinance?

Using two different measures of poverty, the paper examines whether microfinance institutions in Uganda follow a developmental objective by expanding their access to poorer districts; and if the pattern observed varies across different types of MFIs. The analysis is conducted on 118 MFIs over the period 2009 \u2013 2013; adopting a static count data model and dynamic regression approach. We find that MFIs in Uganda are more likely to target richer districts during earlier years; however, poorer districts tend to catch up over time. This finding suggests that MFIs may wish to signal an improved financial performance by first establishing branches in better-off districts and then only later reaching out to poorer districts, employing cross-subsidisation. We also show that Commercial Bank MFIs are more likely to increase their presence in poorer districts than other types of MFIs, suggesting that protection against regulation and greater access to capital markets may make commercial MFIs the most qualified institutions to expand outreach to the unbanked segment of the world\u2019s poorer population.", "filtered_title": ["mission", "drift", "microfin", "new", "empir", "evid", "uganda", "franci", "darko", "paper", "consid", "possibl", "mission", "drift", "microfin", "situat", "microfin", "institut", "mfis", "move", "away", "target", "poor", "toward", "better", "client", "use", "two", "differ", "measur", "poverti", "paper", "examin", "whether", "microfin", "institut", "uganda", "follow", "development", "object", "expand", "access", "poorer", "district", "pattern", "observ", "vari", "across", "differ", "type", "mfis", "analysi", "conduct", "118", "mfis", "period", "2009", "2013", "adopt", "static", "count", "data", "model", "dynam", "regress", "approach", "find", "mfis", "uganda", "like", "target", "richer", "district", "earlier", "year", "howev", "poorer", "district", "tend", "catch", "time", "find", "suggest", "mfis", "may", "wish", "signal", "improv", "financi", "perform", "first", "establish", "branch", "better", "district", "later", "reach", "poorer", "district", "employ", "cross", "subsidis", "also", "show", "commerci", "bank", "mfis", "like", "increas", "presenc", "poorer", "district", "type", "mfis", "suggest", "protect", "regul", "greater", "access", "capit", "market", "may", "make", "commerci", "mfis", "qualifi", "institut", "expand", "outreach", "unbank", "segment", "world", "poorer", "popul"]}, "c9ba77a9-700d-425e-8ca6-6d6d3dceccb8": {"title": "Law, Politics, and the Quality of Government in Africa", "author_name": "S.A.

From the perspective of port authorities or governments, knowing the Minimum Efficient Scale (MES) is salient, because they sometimes determine the port development or expansion based on the port capacity or the existing size of the terminal. Notwithstanding the importance of knowing the exact MES, extant literature has not managed to estimate MES in the port industry. This study aims to estimate the MES in the port industry in South Korea in order to identify whether Container Terminal Operators (CTOs) are under economies of scale, constant economies of scale or diseconomies of scale; we explore a bottom point of the average cost curve in order to suggest an adequate scale for the port industry in Korea. The finding demonstrates that undercapacity may be a strong issue in Korean container ports. However, CTOs in Busan port are in an overcapacity area given the market demand of container throughput in 2013, which is approximately 25 times larger than the estimated MES; in fact, all CTOs in Busan port operate at more than 20% of MES. This study then can provide port policy makers with a helpful tool to derive ex-ante MES level at the terminal designing stage and to adjust ex-post port investment decisions at the additional port capacity designing stage, which may contribute to avoiding overcapacity.NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Transport Policy.

It also evaluates the effect of the introduction of a code of corporate governance on compliance rates across Ghanaian firms as well as assessing the impact of the code\u2019s introduction on firm performance for the study period 2000-2009.\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThe paper develops a Ghanaian corporate governance index (GCGI) containing 33 provisions to measure corporate governance quality during the pre-code and the post-code sub-periods. The authors use a panel data analytical framework and fixed effects regressions to analyse the governance-performance relationships.\nFindings\n\nAfter controlling for endogeneity, the authors find a statistically significant and positive relationship between the GCGI and firm performance. The analysis shows evidence of a statistically significant increase in the degree of compliance with the Ghanaian Code from the pre-2003 sub-period to the post-2003 sub-period. The authors also find that the introduction of the code has led to improved firm performance. However, not all elements of corporate governance appear to have a significant effect on firm performance.\nResearch limitations/implications\n\nOne limitation of this study is the development of a corporate governance index. The binary coding used to construct the GCGI may not reflect the relative importance of the different corporate governance provisions. This means that all elements included in the index are given equal weighting. Future research may assign weights to each of the corporate governance provisions but this may have the disadvantage of making subjective judgements relative to the importance of each corporate governance provision recommended by the Ghanaian Code.\nPractical implications\n\nThese results have important implications for both policy makers and companies. For policy makers, it is encouraging for the development of a code of corporate governance to regulate firms rather than enforcing rigid laws that may not be value relevant. For companies, the improvement in compliance with a code of corporate governance can provide a means of achieving improved performance.\nOriginality/value\n\nThis paper adds to the limited evidence on the governance-performance relationship in developing economies and in particular it analyses the role of a governance index. It is also the first paper to compare the pre- and the post-code governance index-performance relationship in an African or developing country.", "filtered_title": ["govern", "perform", "relationship", "evid", "ghana", "andrew", "owusu", "c", "weir", "purpos", "purpos", "paper", "investig", "impact", "corpor", "govern", "measur", "govern", "index", "perform", "list", "firm", "develop", "economi", "ghana", "also", "evalu", "effect", "introduct", "code", "corpor", "govern", "complianc", "rate", "across", "ghanaian", "firm", "well", "assess", "impact", "code", "introduct", "firm", "perform", "studi", "period", "2000", "2009", "design", "methodolog", "approach", "paper", "develop", "ghanaian", "corpor", "govern", "index", "gcgi", "contain", "33", "provis", "measur", "corpor", "govern", "qualiti", "pre", "code", "post", "code", "sub", "period", "author", "use", "panel", "data", "analyt", "framework", "fix", "effect", "regress", "analys", "govern", "perform", "relationship", "find", "control", "endogen", "author", "find", "statist", "signific", "posit", "relationship", "gcgi", "firm", "perform", "analysi", "show", "evid", "statist", "signific", "increas", "degre", "complianc", "ghanaian", "code", "pre", "2003", "sub", "period", "post", "2003", "sub", "period", "author", "also", "find", "introduct", "code", "led", "improv", "firm", "perform", "howev", "element", "corpor", "govern", "appear", "signific", "effect", "firm", "perform", "research", "limit", "implic", "one", "limit", "studi", "develop", "corpor", "govern", "index", "binari", "code", "use", "construct", "gcgi", "may", "reflect", "relat", "import", "differ", "corpor", "govern", "provis", "mean", "element", "includ", "index", "given", "equal", "weight", "futur", "research", "may", "assign", "weight", "corpor", "govern", "provis", "may", "disadvantag", "make", "subject", "judgement", "relat", "import", "corpor", "govern", "provis", "recommend", "ghanaian", "code", "practic", "implic", "result", "import", "implic", "polici", "maker", "compani", "polici", "maker", "encourag", "develop", "code", "corpor", "govern", "regul", "firm", "rather", "enforc", "rigid", "law", "may", "valu", "relev", "compani", "improv", "complianc", "code", "corpor", "govern", "provid", "mean", "achiev", "improv", "perform", "origin", "valu", "paper", "add", "limit", "evid", "govern", "perform", "relationship", "develop", "economi", "particular", "analys", "role", "govern", "index", "also", "first", "paper", "compar", "pre", "post", "code", "govern", "index", "perform", "relationship", "african", "develop", "countri"]}, "72a0571b-117f-48aa-9199-9d5cfe87ced7": {"title": "The impact of seaports on the regional economies in South Korea: Panel evidence from the augmented Solow model", "author_name": "Jin Suk Park, Y-J.

The following are the main findings. First, there is an unconditional positive effect of mobile phone penetration on good governance. Second, the net effects on political, economic, and institutional governances that are associated with the interaction of the mobile phone with knowledge diffusion variables are positive for the most part. Third, countries with low levels of governance are catching-up their counterparts with higher levels of governance. The above findings are broadly consistent with theoretical underpinnings on the relevance of mobile phones in mitigating bad governance in Africa. The evidence of some insignificant net effects and decreasing marginal impacts may be an indication that the mobile phone could also be employed to decrease government quality. Overall, this study has established net positive effects for the most part. Five rationales could elicit the positive net effects on good governance from the interaction between mobile phones and knowledge diffusion, among others, the knowledge variables enhance: reach, access, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and interaction.

It employs a battery of interactive estimation techniques, namely: Fixed effects, Generalised Method of Moments and Tobit regressions. Concepts of political (voice and accountability and political stability/no violence), economic (government effectiveness and regulation quality) and institutional (corruption-control and rule of law) governance are employed. The following findings are established. The previously apparent positive correlation between mobile phones and inclusive development can be extended to a positive effect. Although political governance is overwhelmingly not significant across estimated models, the average effects from economic governance are higher relative to institutional governance. On the interactions between mobile phones and governance variables, while none are apparent in Fixed effects regressions, there are significant synergy effects in Generalised Method of Moments and Tobit estimations, notably, from: regulation quality in the former and political stability, voice and accountability and rule of law in the latter. There is consistent evidence of convergence in inclusive human development.

The Ghanaian Code of corporate governance introduced in 2003 was the first attempt to make official corporate governance guidelines on best practices not backed by the force of law of which the Ghanaian firms were encouraged to comply with its provisions. As such, firms listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange are expected to comply with the recommended governance provisions in order to promote good corporate governance. Some of the key provisions in the code are separating the posts of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the board of directors, limiting the board size to between eight and sixteen directors, having at least one-third of the total membership of the board to be independent directors, and the establishment of separate board committees to be responsible for audit and executive remuneration. Other provisions call for improvement of the relationship between shareholders and managers, and provisions on financial affairs, auditing and disclosure practices. We develop a corporate governance index and its six subindices to measure firm-level governance quality. Annual reports of the Ghanaian listed firms are scored according to their governance disclosure during the whole period, 2000\u20132009 and pre 2003 and post 2003 introduction of the Ghanaian Code. A panel data analytical framework was used to find the determinants of strong corporate governance in Ghanaian listed firms. The empirical results over the whole period, 2000\u20132009 show statistically significant and positive relationship between external financing needs, firm size, institutional shareholdings and governance quality measured by the Ghanaian corporate governance index. While we find no relationship between external financing needs, director shareholding and governance quality pre 2003, the result is positive and statistically significant for post 2003. The most consistent relationship we find concerns firm size and institutional shareholdings. However, growth opportunities and firm performance measures appear to have no association with strong governance in Ghanaian firms. The results have important implications for the Ghanaian firms and regulators.

Its twin motivations are the importance of information on future house price movements to sector stakeholders and the limited number of related Lithuanian property market studies.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs ARIMA modelling approach.

It then examines issues relating to an application of this univariate time-series modelling technique in a forecasting context.FindingsAs the results of the study suggest, ARIMA is a useful technique to assess broad market price changes. Government and central bank can use ARIMA modelling approach to forecast national house price inflation. Developers can employ this methodology to drive successful house-building programme. Investor can incorporate forecasts from ARIMA models into investment strategy for timing purposes.Research limitations/implicationsCertainly, there are number of limitations attached to this particular modelling approach. Firm predictions about house price movements are also a challenge, as well as more research needs to be done in establishing a dynamic interrelationship between macro variables and the Lithuanian housing market.Originality/valueAlthough the research focused on Lithuania, the findings extend to global housing market. ARIMA house price modelling provides insights for a spectrum of stakeholders. The use of this modelling approach can be employed to improve monetary policy oversight, facilitate planning for infrastructure or social housing as a countercyclical policy and mitigate risk for investors.

CSR movement and CSR reportingpractices by financial sector have gathered great momentum in recent years. Banking sector is in the leading position in discharging CSR reporting.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The sample composed of all the 30 banking companies enlisted in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), and the study used content analysis approach for systematic categorization and analysis of the contents reported in the annual report. A total of 97 CSR items classified into seven classes were selected through a relevant literature review, as the expected itemsand average, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, percentage and correlation, etc. were used as the tools of analysis. SPSS software version 19.0 was used to analyze the data. An ordinary least square (OLS) regression model is fitted to the data for assessing the effect of independent variables on total CSRreporting score.Findings \u2013 The study found that the extent of CSR reporting in banking companies in Bangladesh varies from 27.84 to 65.98 per cent, and on an average, they report 47.39 per cent of the expected CSR items in annual report. It is also observed that banking companies in Bangladesh emphasized onlinguistic or written form than charts, graphs or pictures in reporting CSR activities to their stakeholders, and the study found no significant influence of the selected bank characteristics on the extent of CSR reporting. Moreover, the study observed significant impact of regulatory change on nature and extent of CSR reporting.Research limitations/implications \u2013 The study considered all the listed commercial banking companies in Bangladesh, and the annual report of 2011 was taken as the main source of data.Social implications \u2013 Among others, the implications of the study include the following. Banking companies are expected to get a real scenario of CSR reporting of the banking sector in Bangladesh and banking companies with poor CSR contribution expected to be motivated for contributing more in CSRactivities.

Further research investigating key determinants of compliance/non-compliance to the CCG is very crucial in understanding the context of compliance with CCG.\nPractical implications \u2013 Despite the evidence showing positive association between compliance with CCG and investor confidence, there is no evidence that Nigerian banks appreciate the value of such compliance. The results of this study imply a serious negative ramification on the compliance level with the Basel III and potential loss of confidence of international investors.\nOriginality/value \u2013 The essence of compliance to boosting investor confidence is paramount in emerging world particularly with the recent accounting scandals that reshape our views of various aspects of CG. No any framework for measuring compliance is in place by the central bank. Therefore this study establishes a pragmatic framework that will assess the degree of compliance by the Nigerian banks with a view to ensuring safeguard of the depositors\u2019 funds and re-building investors\u2019 confidence in the Nigerian financial system particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis that negatively affected banks across the globe.

This study compares the financial reporting quality of Hong Kong firms which are cross-listed in mainland China with those of Hong Kong firms cross-listed in China using specific earnings management metrics (earnings smoothing, timely loss recognition, value relevance and managing towards earnings targets) under pre- and post-IFRS regimes.\n\nThe financial reporting quality of Chinese A-share companies and Hong Kong listed companies are examined using earnings management measures. Using 2007 as base year, the study used a cumulative of \u22125 and +5 years of convergence experience which provide a total of 3,000 firm-year observations. In addition to regression analyses, we used the difference-in-difference analysis to check for the impact of regulatory environments on earnings management.\n\nThrough the lens of contingency theory, our results indicate that the adoption of the new substantially IFRS-convergent accounting standards in China results in better financial reporting quality evidenced by less earning management. The empirical results further shows that accounting data are more value relevant for Hong Kong listed firms, and that firms listed in China are more likely to engage in accrual-based earnings management than in real earnings management activities. We established that different earnings management practices that are seemingly tolerable in one country may not be tolerable in another due to level of differences in the regulatory environments.\n\nThe findings show that Hong Kong listed companies\u2019 exhibit higher level of financial reporting quality than Chinese listed companies, which implies that the financial reporting quality under IFRS can be significantly different in regions with different institutional, economic and regulatory environments. The results imply that contingent factors such as country\u2019s institutional structures, its extent of regulation and the strength of its investor protection environments impact on financial reporting quality particularly in transitional and emerging economies. As such, these factors need to be given appropriate considerations by financial reporting regulators and policy-makers interested in controlling earnings management practices among their corporations.\n\nThis study is a high impact study considering that China plays a significant role in today\u2019s globalised economy. This study is unique as it the first, that we are aware of, to compare real earnings activities against accrual-based earnings management in pre- and post-IFRS adoption periods within the Chinese and Hong Kong financial reporting environments, distinguishing between cross-listed and non-cross-listed firms.\n\n", "filtered_title": ["regulatori", "environ", "affect", "earn", "manag", "transit", "economi", "empir", "examin", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "cross", "list", "firm", "china", "hong", "kong", "matthia", "nnadi", "kamil", "omoteso", "yi", "yu", "paper", "provid", "evid", "impact", "regulatori", "environ", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "transit", "economi", "studi", "compar", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "hong", "kong", "firm", "cross", "list", "mainland", "china", "hong", "kong", "firm", "cross", "list", "china", "use", "specif", "earn", "manag", "metric", "earn", "smooth", "time", "loss", "recognit", "valu", "relev", "manag", "toward", "earn", "target", "pre", "post", "ifr", "regim", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "chines", "share", "compani", "hong", "kong", "list", "compani", "examin", "use", "earn", "manag", "measur", "use", "2007", "base", "year", "studi", "use", "cumul", "5", "5", "year", "converg", "experi", "provid", "total", "3", "000", "firm", "year", "observ", "addit", "regress", "analys", "use", "differ", "differ", "analysi", "check", "impact", "regulatori", "environ", "earn", "manag", "len", "conting", "theori", "result", "indic", "adopt", "new", "substanti", "ifr", "converg", "account", "standard", "china", "result", "better", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "evidenc", "less", "earn", "manag", "empir", "result", "show", "account", "data", "valu", "relev", "hong", "kong", "list", "firm", "firm", "list", "china", "like", "engag", "accrual", "base", "earn", "manag", "real", "earn", "manag", "activ", "establish", "differ", "earn", "manag", "practic", "seem", "toler", "one", "countri", "may", "toler", "anoth", "due", "level", "differ", "regulatori", "environ", "find", "show", "hong", "kong", "list", "compani", "exhibit", "higher", "level", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "chines", "list", "compani", "impli", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "ifr", "signific", "differ", "region", "differ", "institut", "econom", "regulatori", "environ", "result", "impli", "conting", "factor", "countri", "institut", "structur", "extent", "regul", "strength", "investor", "protect", "environ", "impact", "financi", "report", "qualiti", "particular", "transit", "emerg", "economi", "factor", "need", "given", "appropri", "consider", "financi", "report", "regul", "polici", "maker", "interest", "control", "earn", "manag", "practic", "among", "corpor", "studi", "high", "impact", "studi", "consid", "china", "play", "signific", "role", "today", "globalis", "economi", "studi", "uniqu", "first", "awar", "compar", "real", "earn", "activ", "accrual", "base", "earn", "manag", "pre", "post", "ifr", "adopt", "period", "within", "chines", "hong", "kong", "financi", "report", "environ", "distinguish", "cross", "list", "non", "cross", "list", "firm"]}, "6a02f317-e861-49e4-b734-4e9ec8a0da6c": {"title": "Effects of Exchange Rate Volatility on Tourist Flows into Iceland", "author_name": "G.

This paper uses a panel of countries to identify the net effect of armed conflict and terrorism, both domestic and international, on aid receipts. It shows that armed conflict has a negative effect on the amounts of both bilateral and multilateral aid. It also finds that terrorism tends to increase foreign assistance. The effect is stronger for bilateral aid; this is consistent with the expectation that they are likely to use foreign aid to directly or indirectly assist governments fighting terrorism.

The empirical evidence is based on updated data from 52 African countries for the period 1996\u20132010. An endogeneity robust instrumental variable Two-Stage-Least Squares empirical strategy is employed. The findings reveal that development assistance deteriorates economic (regulation quality and government effectiveness) and institutional (corruption-control and rule of law) governance, but has an insignificant effect on political (political stability, voice and accountability) governance. While, these findings are broadly in accordance with Moyo and Collier on weak governance, they neither confirm the Eubank position on political governance nor the Asongu stance on the aid-corruption nexus in a debate with Okada and Samreth. The use of foreign aid as an instrument to influence the election and replacement of political leaders in Africa may have insignificant results.

In addition, there is a strong evidence of a growth effect. Firms or industry portfolios with smaller book-to-market ratios have significantly higher returns. In contrast, beta is never statistically significant. The above results are robust to firm- and industry- level regressions, and the formation of firms into 100 size-beta portfolios. Our findings indicate that competitive industries earn, on average, higher risk-adjusted returns than concentrated industries. An explanation is that investors in more competitive industries require larger premiums for greater distress risks associated with these industries.

The study examines the extent to which microfinance institutions reach the poor and investigates the factors influencing participation in microfinance programmes.

First, the locations of structural breaks are identified by Bai and Perron\u2019s (1998) method. Then, it is estimated how a hazard rate changes in duration between structural breaks by parametric duration analysis using the Weibull and the log-logistic hazard functions. This study reveals the evidence of positive duration dependence, that is, stability is destabilizing, in 13 out of 27 international stock indices and the pooled data. In other words, as one regime continues over time with unchanged parameter values, a new structural break is more likely to occur. This method discloses a lower degree of duration dependence than the duration-dependence Markov-switching model (Durland and McCurdy, 1994) that considers temporary switches between a limited number of regimes. Also, some new patterns are emerged, e.g., more predominant positive duration dependence in bear markets, the secondary stock exchanges of a country and developing countries.Publisher statement: This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Applied Economics on 28th November 2014, available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2014.985370 .", "filtered_title": ["durat", "analysi", "structur", "break", "stabil", "destabil", "jin", "suk", "park", "articl", "investig", "durat", "regim", "e", "length", "stabil", "affect", "likelihood", "perman", "structur", "break", "devis", "durat", "depend", "structur", "break", "method", "combin", "structur", "break", "test", "durat", "depend", "test", "first", "locat", "structur", "break", "identifi", "bai", "perron", "1998", "method", "estim", "hazard", "rate", "chang", "durat", "structur", "break", "parametr", "durat", "analysi", "use", "weibul", "log", "logist", "hazard", "function", "studi", "reveal", "evid", "posit", "durat", "depend", "stabil", "destabil", "13", "27", "intern", "stock", "indic", "pool", "data", "word", "one", "regim", "continu", "time", "unchang", "paramet", "valu", "new", "structur", "break", "like", "occur", "method", "disclos", "lower", "degre", "durat", "depend", "durat", "depend", "markov", "switch", "model", "durland", "mccurdi", "1994", "consid", "temporari", "switch", "limit", "number", "regim", "also", "new", "pattern", "emerg", "e", "g", "predomin", "posit", "durat", "depend", "bear", "market", "secondari", "stock", "exchang", "countri", "develop", "countri", "publish", "statement", "accept", "manuscript", "articl", "publish", "taylor", "franci", "appli", "econom", "28th", "novemb", "2014", "avail", "onlin", "http", "www", "tandfonlin", "com", "doi", "ab", "10", "1080", "00036846", "2014", "985370"]}, "6802a269-bb85-4b75-b2de-da426570cf64": {"title": "The economy wide impact of HIV/AIDS and the funding dilemma in Africa: Evidence from a dynamic life cycle horizon of Uganda", "author_name": "Judith Kabajulizi, Mthuli Ncube", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-economy-wide-impact-of-hivaids-and-the-funding-dilemma-in-afr", "date": "Sep 2015", "data_desc": "HIV/AIDS compared to the rest of the word. This paper analyses the long-term economic effects of HIV/AIDS using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Taking Uganda as a case study for analysis, the paper aims to predict the economic impact of HIV/AIDS through: (i) the human resource channel and, (ii) the source of fiscal space for HIV/AIDS channel, and proposes policy options for funding HIV interventions in the long-term. The paper shows that if the government intervenes by scaling up treatment and prevention of HIV, the negative economic impacts of HIV/AIDS \u2013 including the soaring cost of production due to rising wages, declining GDP growth rates relative to the base, and the rising domestic debt as share of GDP \u2013 are reversed. The economy thrives from a growing labour force supply and resource flows to HIV interventions. Foreign-aid and direct taxation are both potential sources of fiscal space for HIV albeit with differential impacts on sectoral growth and government debt levels. The study demonstrates that low-income-countries (LICs) like Uganda have the capacity to mobilise domestic resources to fund HIV interventions by increasing revenues from direct taxes. It is recommended that policymakers \u2013 in Uganda and other LICs grappling with similar challenges \u2013 devise means to increase revenue from direct taxes particularly by tapping into the large informal sector. The paper also proposes that in the short to medium term, development-aid for health be increased in order for government to meet the future HIV/AIDS obligations.

This note extends what we know on this nexus in a threefold manner: namely, in terms of: incremental, lifelong learning and synergy effects. Four main findings are established. First, education is a powerful tool in the fight against corruption. Second, there is evidence of an incremental effect in the transition from secondary to tertiary education. Third, lifelong learning defined as knowledge acquired during primary, secondary and tertiary education negatively affects corruption. Fourth, there is evidence of a \u2018synergy effect\u2019 because the impact of lifelong learning is higher than the combined effects of various educational levels. The empirical evidence is based on 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. Two main policy implications are derived.

As J.A. Schumpeter (1934) and other scholars (such as Shackle, 1967) have recognized the central role of credit creation in the economic system, a new perspective on the financial role in defining the growth path needs to be developed by filling the gaps in New Growth Theory (NGT) (Aghion and Howitt, 1998) and Evolutionary Theory (ET) (Nelson and Winter, 1982) - which we call the two Sons of Schumpeter - and in some way combining them.

Our main findings are as follows. First, by distinguishing between conventional and Islamic stock market indices, we find that these two groups of investments react heterogeneously to the recent political turmoil. Specifically, we document a significant increase in the volatility of Islamic indices during the period of political unrests whereas the uprisings have had little or no significant effect on the volatility in conventional markets. Such difference is confirmed by further analysis in a multivariate GARCH model. Second, regardless of its impact on volatility, there is little evidence to suggest that MENA markets have become more integrated with international markets after the political revolution. Third, similar results are not found for the benchmark indices which indicate that the changes are the result of political tensions. In general, these results are robust to model specification and consistent with the notion that political uncertainty contributes to financial volatility.

It suggests that this neglected dimension of the experience of Chinese international students in Britain is significant for both their personal well-being and educational outcomes.In the course of my research, nine academic lectures with a total duration of 12 hours and 50 minutes were recorded in two university departments in England. Interviews and group discussions were conducted with 39 Chinese students who attended these lectures regarding potential humour they perceived in the lectures. The lecturers of these lectures were also interviewed. Data analysis shows that many of the Chinese participants encountered difficulty at various levels in understanding humour in the lectures. In many cases they attributed the lack of comprehension to their language problems in a conventional sense, e.g. in relation to vocabulary, speech speed and accents, but they seldom referred to difficulty caused by cultural allusions within the humour. Some participants claimed that \u2018British humour\u2019 was particularly perplexing, but there is recurring evidence in my data showing similarities between the lecturers\u2019 and the Chinese participants\u2019 humour, challenging the latter group\u2019s accounts of the inherent difference between humour in the two cultures they represent.Various studies have reported a particular pattern of socialisation of Chinese students in the U.K.: Chinese students experience much less interaction with British people than they expect, and fall into the habit of stereotyping British people and themselves. In my study, the Chinese students\u2019 discrimination between two national categories of humour may be seen as an example of this habit in action. In my presentation, I will argue that this habit presents clear dangers, and that the students\u2019 tendency to stereotype and to auto-stereotype is an issue requiring further academic attention.", "filtered_title": ["idea", "british", "humour", "39", "chines", "student", "account", "incomprehens", "humour", "british", "academ", "lectur", "yu", "wang", "research", "concern", "chines", "student", "percept", "humour", "british", "academ", "lectur", "suggest", "neglect", "dimens", "experi", "chines", "intern", "student", "britain", "signific", "person", "well", "educ", "outcom", "cours", "research", "nine", "academ", "lectur", "total", "durat", "12", "hour", "50", "minut", "record", "two", "univers", "depart", "england", "interview", "group", "discuss", "conduct", "39", "chines", "student", "attend", "lectur", "regard", "potenti", "humour", "perceiv", "lectur", "lectur", "lectur", "also", "interview", "data", "analysi", "show", "mani", "chines", "particip", "encount", "difficulti", "various", "level", "understand", "humour", "lectur", "mani", "case", "attribut", "lack", "comprehens", "languag", "problem", "convent", "sens", "e", "g", "relat", "vocabulari", "speech", "speed", "accent", "seldom", "refer", "difficulti", "caus", "cultur", "allus", "within", "humour", "particip", "claim", "british", "humour", "particular", "perplex", "recur", "evid", "data", "show", "similar", "lectur", "chines", "particip", "humour", "challeng", "latter", "group", "account", "inher", "differ", "humour", "two", "cultur", "repres", "various", "studi", "report", "particular", "pattern", "socialis", "chines", "student", "u", "k", "chines", "student", "experi", "much", "less", "interact", "british", "peopl", "expect", "fall", "habit", "stereotyp", "british", "peopl", "studi", "chines", "student", "discrimin", "two", "nation", "categori", "humour", "may", "seen", "exampl", "habit", "action", "present", "argu", "habit", "present", "clear", "danger", "student", "tendenc", "stereotyp", "auto", "stereotyp", "issu", "requir", "academ", "attent"]}, "a8c3cfa6-de19-440a-b456-4c9450260ae5": {"title": "Accounting for corporate environmental responsibility in emerging economies: The study from Nigeria", "author_name": "Abdurafiu Noah", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/accounting-for-corporate-environmental-responsibility-in-emerging", "date": "9 Apr 2013", "data_desc": "", "filtered_title": ["account", "corpor", "environment", "respons", "emerg", "economi", "studi", "nigeria", "abdurafiu", "noah"]}, "05fc619c-2949-48ca-8171-9806cdf05f73": {"title": "An Analysis of the Response to Corporate Unbundling Announcements on the Johannesburg Security Exchange", "author_name": "Tasneem Joosub, David Coldwell, Jared Jordan", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/an-analysis-of-the-response-to-corporate-unbundling-announcements", "date": "2013", "data_desc": "This research examines the effect of the announcement of corporate unbundling by South African corporations listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange.

On the other hand donors may provide aid as a reimbursement for counter-terrorist efforts that benefit the donor country. This paper tries to identify the net effect using a panel of countries. It finds that armed conflict does have a large and negative effect on both multilateral and bilateral aid, but that bilateral donors also seem to turn a blind eye to violence in oil exporting countries.

They also report some improvement in the standard of corporate governance in their companies since the introduction of the Code. Many of the company directors indicated their preparedness to comply with further corporate governance requirements, such as the adoption of a formal nomination committee something not been currently included in the Ghanaian Code. However, the directors noted that they receive inadequate support from the regulatory and institutional bodies for the implementation of the Ghanaian Code provisions. Many of the directors also supported the review of the Ghanaian Code by an independent committee. With regard to the adoption of the Ghanaian Code and its influence on firm performance, the respondents indicated that the adoption of the specific governance provisions in the area of chief executive officer (CEO)/chairman roles separation, having a balance of executive and non-executive directors on the board, the establishment of audit and remuneration committees, and the full adoption of the Ghanaian Code provisions were all influential in determining firm performance.

This study applies panel data regression techniques to 10,639 firm-year observations of non-financial Chinese listed firms during 2003\u20132010 to examine the relationship between state ownership and firm performance. The results show that state ownership has a U-shaped relationship with firm performance. The Split Share Structure Reform in 2005\u20132006 played a positive role in enhancing the relationship between state ownership and firm profitability ratios. Although state ownership decreased significantly after 2006, it remains high in strategically important industry sectors such as the oil, natural gas and mining sector and the publishing, broadcasting and media sector. The findings reveal that a higher level of state ownership is superior to a dispersed ownership structure due to the benefits of government support and political connections. The Split Share Structure Reform made previously non-tradable shares legally tradable, improving corporate governance and reducing the negative effect of non-tradable state shares.\n\nPublisher statement: This is an Open Access report distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/), which permits users to copy, distribute and transmit the work for non-commercial purposes providing it is properly cited.", "filtered_title": ["state", "ownership", "firm", "perform", "empir", "evid", "chines", "list", "compani", "mei", "yu", "relationship", "state", "ownership", "firm", "perform", "wide", "research", "empir", "evid", "provid", "mix", "result", "studi", "appli", "panel", "data", "regress", "techniqu", "10", "639", "firm", "year", "observ", "non", "financi", "chines", "list", "firm", "2003", "2010", "examin", "relationship", "state", "ownership", "firm", "perform", "result", "show", "state", "ownership", "u", "shape", "relationship", "firm", "perform", "split", "share", "structur", "reform", "2005", "2006", "play", "posit", "role", "enhanc", "relationship", "state", "ownership", "firm", "profit", "ratio", "although", "state", "ownership", "decreas", "signific", "2006", "remain", "high", "strateg", "import", "industri", "sector", "oil", "natur", "gas", "mine", "sector", "publish", "broadcast", "media", "sector", "find", "reveal", "higher", "level", "state", "ownership", "superior", "dispers", "ownership", "structur", "due", "benefit", "govern", "support", "polit", "connect", "split", "share", "structur", "reform", "made", "previous", "non", "tradabl", "share", "legal", "tradabl", "improv", "corpor", "govern", "reduc", "negat", "effect", "non", "tradabl", "state", "share", "publish", "statement", "open", "access", "report", "distribut", "term", "creativ", "common", "attribut", "non", "commerci", "deriv", "licens", "http", "creativecommon", "org", "licens", "nc", "nd", "3", "0", "permit", "user", "copi", "distribut", "transmit", "work", "non", "commerci", "purpos", "provid", "proper", "cite"]}, "b40e0239-290b-4599-b868-532d928c11ee": {"title": "The effects of strikes in the South African gold mining industry on shareholder value", "author_name": "Tasneem Joosub", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effects-of-strikes-in-the-south-african-gold-mining-industry-", "date": "19 Jul 2013", "data_desc": "The recent spate of strikes in the mining sector in South Africa has created a perceived nervousness amongst shareholders.

Although both types of strikes had a negative impact on shareholder value, an unprotected strike had less of an impact on shareholder value compared to a protected strike.

Transport-oriented development (TOD) could help reconfigure cities towards sustainability.

The allocation, coordination and construction of multiple projects to revamp, connect and beautify can be contentious, complex and expensive. Planning regimes are usually conservative, and have competing objectives and dislocated organisational architectures. The consequence is often high-risk. The resolution to functional, financial and institutional TOD dispute is de-risking in two modes. In Mode 1, developers and government agencies remain separate but collaborate on an ad hoc basis, contaminated by uplift advocacy. In Mode 2, a Special Purpose Vehicle is formally constituted and risks are distributed more transparently. Given transport and financial constraints in many regional cities, Mode 2, or a public-private TOD partnership (PPP), is appealing but not without danger.

However, regardless of these efforts, academic research studies indicate that more efforts are still needed from audit regulators and external auditors.

Park visitors were conveniently sampled through an intercept survey method form. Taman Sri Nibong Park is one of the biggest neighborhood parks in Pulau Pinang. A total of 173 questionnaires were returned. The data were analyzed through the use of descriptive statistics.FindingsBy knowing the needs and preferences of visitors and neighborhood residents, the present study concludes that more efforts should be made to include certain qualities in designing neighborhood areas to attract more visitors and investors. Related to the effectiveness of design on park users' perceptions and preferences, this study as well as observations has found that park users perceive some elements of environmental design, like physical barriers of fences and hedges between playground and the football field, effective in protecting users from accident and injury in the park. Another suggestion, which users made was for more supervisors to be in the park or playground to take care of the children while they use the equipment.Research limitations/implicationsThe current study is limited in its scope because of the need to complete the study within a limited time and budget. Future studies are needed to explore how design strategies of Neighborhood Parks can satisfy urban neighborhood populations and also support social business development. The directions for future research are identified as more research should be conducted in this regard and more neighborhood parks should be considered allowing for comparison among them.Practical implicationsThis research would enable landscape architects and environmental designers as well as business and community developers to match specific developmental goals of urban neighborhood environmental planning. It can influence business strategies to attract more investment by the community developer, and also this new approach can influence the future of the society and its sustainability.Originality/valueThe paper challenges the traditional view of parks as places that only incur social expense to a new perception that views them as revenue and social business places.", "filtered_title": ["park", "busi", "opportun", "develop", "strategi", "maryam", "mani", "mehdi", "hosseini", "ramayah", "purposeth", "aim", "studi", "identifi", "factor", "user", "find", "import", "use", "neighborhood", "park", "evalu", "design", "neighborhood", "park", "view", "point", "user", "consid", "impact", "well", "design", "neighborhood", "park", "busi", "strategi", "compar", "tradit", "view", "design", "methodolog", "approachth", "popul", "studi", "drawn", "park", "user", "neighborhood", "resid", "park", "visitor", "conveni", "sampl", "intercept", "survey", "method", "form", "taman", "sri", "nibong", "park", "one", "biggest", "neighborhood", "park", "pulau", "pinang", "total", "173", "questionnair", "return", "data", "analyz", "use", "descript", "statist", "findingsbi", "know", "need", "prefer", "visitor", "neighborhood", "resid", "present", "studi", "conclud", "effort", "made", "includ", "certain", "qualiti", "design", "neighborhood", "area", "attract", "visitor", "investor", "relat", "effect", "design", "park", "user", "percept", "prefer", "studi", "well", "observ", "found", "park", "user", "perceiv", "element", "environment", "design", "like", "physic", "barrier", "fenc", "hedg", "playground", "footbal", "field", "effect", "protect", "user", "accid", "injuri", "park", "anoth", "suggest", "user", "made", "supervisor", "park", "playground", "take", "care", "children", "use", "equip", "research", "limit", "implicationsth", "current", "studi", "limit", "scope", "need", "complet", "studi", "within", "limit", "time", "budget", "futur", "studi", "need", "explor", "design", "strategi", "neighborhood", "park", "satisfi", "urban", "neighborhood", "popul", "also", "support", "social", "busi", "develop", "direct", "futur", "research", "identifi", "research", "conduct", "regard", "neighborhood", "park", "consid", "allow", "comparison", "among", "practic", "implicationsthi", "research", "would", "enabl", "landscap", "architect", "environment", "design", "well", "busi", "communiti", "develop", "match", "specif", "development", "goal", "urban", "neighborhood", "environment", "plan", "influenc", "busi", "strategi", "attract", "invest", "communiti", "develop", "also", "new", "approach", "influenc", "futur", "societi", "sustain", "origin", "valueth", "paper", "challeng", "tradit", "view", "park", "place", "incur", "social", "expens", "new", "percept", "view", "revenu", "social", "busi", "place"]}, "c1b48366-984a-49df-bb1d-e22b19b1db53": {"title": "Student Aspiration Factors, University Reputation and the Entry Standards to UK Universities", "author_name": "Hiba Massoud, Rami Ayoubi", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/student-aspiration-factors-university-reputation-and-the-entry-st", "date": "1 Oct 2012", "data_desc": "The main aim of this study is to investigate the main internal capabilities that would affect the entry standards to UK universities.

Employing three different measures of the auditor\u2019s economic dependence on clients, the study finds evidence in support of the hypothesized link between two of the three measures and discretionary accruals in reporting companies. Extending the investigation, the study also tests whether a threshold level for the relative amounts of audit and non-audit service fees can distinguish between the circumstances when independence may be weakened and when it is not. The results reveal evidence of higher discretionary accruals when the level of non-audit service fees reaches a level of 150% of audit fees but that this relationship is not present when the level rises above 200%, suggesting that auditors may be more conscious of the potential threats to perceived independence when NAS reach this higher level. The study thus provides some evidence in support of the hypothesis that higher NAS fees and total fees to the auditor are positively correlated with the magnitude of discretionary accruals, but also that this relationship is more complicated than implied by a linear regression. The findings add to those of prior studies which have employed accruals based measures of audit quality to test the effect of joint audit and non-audit service provision. The paper also makes a contribution to the continuing policy debate over joint provision reflected in consultations and commentaries on regulation in this area such as the European Commission 2011 proposals for a ban on NAS provision to public interest entity audit clients in Europe and similar discussion in the 2009 report of the UK parliamentary Treasury Select Committee.

Its remarkable growth was driven by cheap labour and foreign investmentwhich became frenzied.1 The crisis exposed the Emirate\u2019s vulnerability.

It largely avoided the interventionist mistakes of Lingah, in Iran, or those of its neighbour, Sharjah.2 In the nineteenth century its wealth was derived from pearling but after the 1960s oil provided the money for some astute investments such as Jebel Ali port. Noteworthy Emirati commercial icons today include Emirates Airlines and Dubai Ports World. Some credit Dubai success to its relatively progressive regime which certainly compares favourably with the dismal performance of many of its Middle Eastern Arab peers.3 Dubai successfully harnessed a diverse workforce \u2013 a seemingly incongruous mix of Arabs, South Asians, Persians and Westerners. After 1990, it re-configured its affluence around real estate, tourism and financial services which supplement its flourishing re-export business. Cheap money, ambitious growth plans and loose immigration restrictions primed real estate speculation in Dubai. The catalyst for its property price bubble was the promulgation in 2002 of a new law to allow selective foreign property ownership.4 Dubai became a conduit for international and regional oil liquidity from soaring Gulf oil exports. By July 2008, relentless global industrial growth had pushed oil prices to US$147 per barrel. As with most bubbles, spin prolonged irrational exuberance.5 Dubai\u2019s rulers promulgated a string of at first only grandiose but later superlative and even phantasmagorial projects such as the world\u2019s tallest tower. Cheap credit, funnelled through Dubai\u2019s poorly regulated banks, financed these construction fantasies but, by 2007, the debt binge had become unsustainable. Credit was growing at almost 50 percent annually. Then, in October 2008, equity markets crashed.

Within the cooperation between the Syrian Government and the European Commission and with a budget of over 14 million Euros, the Higher Institute for Business Administration (HIBA) was founded in 2002. This institution is officially considered as the only public business school in Syria, and since its establishment, it attracted many students for both postgraduate and undergraduate. This study aims at identifying the determinants of customer (student)\u2019 satisfaction at HIBA for MBA and EMBA students.Design, methodology and approach: Using a quantitative survey of 52 factors quoted from a study done by Douglas et al (2006) and divided into 7Ps according to Ivy (2008) marketing mix model for business schools, both customer expectations and satisfactions were measured.Findings: For 55 MBA and EMBA students who participated in the study, the descriptive analysis show that students' expectations were high before registering at HIBA, however, during the actual experience of the course, students\u2019 satisfaction diminished.

The present article argues that those views are based on a restrictive use of the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing model. When the model is used less restrictively, put-option prices are found to decrease as the investment horizon lengthens so long as investment growth is sufficiently high and/or volatility is sufficiently low. Risk, as measured by the cost of hedging, may decline as the holding period lengthens. Dependent upon expected investment growth and volatility, option theory supports time diversification rather than refuting it.One implication is that index funds may be more likely to provide time diversification than actively managed funds.

Using a data set of 72 companies from Damascus, Aleppo, and Dair Ezzor and utilising factor and cluster analysis, the data set and analysis results prove the validity of the model and suggest Syrian businessmen and manages could be classified into two groups according to their CSR perspectives and their marketing motivations.

A proper understanding of premia is hindered by the variety of exogenous influences determining them. They occur within idiosyncratic, complex, and continuously reconfiguring metropoli, conditioned by topography, history, regime, commerce, and culture. Given imperfectly competitive housing markets, conventional explanations for premia are either restricted to their financial dissection, trawl though metrics or cast around for hedonic coefficients. However, premia illuminate affordability and other problems in the broader planning and social debate. With the general significance of premia clarified, the research question of the project becomes: \u2018What drives residential property price premium evolution in a metropolis?\u2019 A complete answer involves dissecting the nature and establishing the location of putative premia and disentangling the influence and interactions of their various price drivers. To provide it, the project conducts a property and urban literature review. Based on theory\u2019s insight that higher order contains lower order systems, it develops and investigates a general systems model of residential premia with two modes. The system is conditioned by ideology but forced by population and capital inflows. Within it, premia mutate, influenced by a nested hierarchy of more or less contaminated information. To investigate the model and its different modes, the project employs tests across system pointers, at the macro, meso (all urban) and micro spatial resolutions. First, the turbulence and permeability of residential property markets to exogenous influences is assessed. The project then looks at the urban mosaic in the growing Sunbelt migration city of Brisbane, Australia, over the boom period from 1998-2004. Locally, it conducts a case study and survey in one micro-location, seeking clues in transaction patterns (output), property system agents (components) and the information they use (feedback mechanisms). Finally, the project draws some relevant policy implications. Its key findings are that urban housing markets are open, complex and polarised. In an exuberant economic climate, migration and debt fuel metropolitan price escalation. Public urban initiatives reinforce central incumbent affluence or spark fresh bouts of speculation. Individual premia are heterogeneous but often feed off local construction projects or iconic refurbishment. Reflecting their demographics and motives, agent risk appetites are diverse although investors are usually less averse to renewal. System feedback involves a congruence of media and local activity signals. Neither local conviviality nor Bohemian influences are, by themselves, significant. Rather, buyer rationality is validated by post-purchase infrastructure completions. The thesis of this project is, hence, that in euphoric capital markets, migration and debt accelerates the endogenous mutation of property from homes within a community towards speculative paper assets. The implication is that the excessive proliferation of premia indicates economic imbalance and urban malaise which requires recognition and treatment. While premia are paid for perceived privilege or prospects, cognitive risk representations and expectations evolve. Sometimes judgment is contaminated by media fantasy but often validated by accommodating government policy and central revitalisation projects. Yet, within a wider social and ecological remit, rampant premia suggest flaws in urban strategy, governance and planning practice. In terms of windfall events or unearned rent, the cumulative effects of ill-considered projects and price distortions can be ugly and wasteful. They alienate and accentuate spatial privilege without generating sustainable jobs. The project has procedural and substantive policy implications. The dynamics of residential premia cannot be disentangled from capital market volatility, urban fragmentation and reconstitution. Enlightened property development requires visionary urban planning beyond electoral cycles. Rather than unregulated markets or disjointed incrementalism, the project points to the advantages of cohesive projects and inclusive hubs. It impels ecological and people-focused development to nurture capable, connected and considerate edge communities. Its first steps are theoretical recognition, policy clarification, government reform, market constraints, price and tax rationalisation and spatial transparency.", "filtered_title": ["evolut",

Second, variables measuring political risk and social development are developed so that these pressures can be measured, thereby introducing new dimensions to the literature. In common with previous studies, financial risk, size and other control variables are included. The relationships are tested econometrically utilising regression techniques not previously applied in the CSD literature but nonetheless more generally appropriate when using count dependent variables.

Based on the Syrian National Standard Medical Test, this paper looks at the accumulated experience in the Syrian Arab Republic, explains the country\u2019s practices in managing and assuring the quality of international medical education of returning graduates, and evaluates the national efforts paid in this context. First the paper assesses the size of the problem in Syria by providing and discussing some statistics provided by the candidates applying to the Syrian National Standard Medical Test. Then it empirically investigates the educational and other related characteristics of the candidates who failed passing the medical quality assurance procedures (including the test). The data is collected from the candidates\u2019 application records over a period of three years. The study further investigates how successful the test and the other related quality assurance procedures are on the light of the empirical test\u2019s results. The evaluation of the quality assurance procedures is done by interviewing some of the key Syrian higher education players. This study is the first academic study tackling the response of Syrian higher education sector towards globalisation concerns. The study highlights the difficulties encountered by Syrian decision maskers in a number of dimensions including the political, the ethical and the social.

In common with previous studies, financial risk, size and other control variables are included. The relationships are tested econometrically utilising regression techniques not previously applied in the CSD literature but nonetheless more generally appropriate when using count dependent variables.

A number of hypotheses are investigated including, in particular, FDI-led growth and export-led growth, as well as the reverse linkages from growth to FDI and exports. The importance of human capital is highlighted as complementary to trade and FDI inflows, underlying the importance of technology adoption. We find that, after controlling for domestic investment, government expenditure and imports, support for FDI-led growth is not as strong as export-led growth, although allowing for the joint interaction of FDI and human capital reveals a positive FDI effect above a minimum threshold of human capital, estimated to be around 4.5 years of average secondary schooling attainment. Extending our study using multivariate causality tests conducted within a vector error correction framework, we also find significant effects of domestic investment and trade openness, providing support for import-led growth, but direct support for FDI-led growth as well as growth-led FDI is again relatively weak, reinforcing the conclusion that trade openness has played a more significant role than FDI in influencing Thai economic growth. But the results reveal a subtle role for technology transfer through the complementary effect of trade on FDI, and FDI on government expenditure, which thereby influences human capital development with spillovers onto domestic investment and growth. This leads us to argue that there is a potential role for FDI interacting with human capital in influencing the future development of the Thai economy, given its recently active policy of FDI promotion.", "filtered_title": ["human", "capit", "trade", "fdi", "econom", "growth", "thailand", "caus", "sailesh", "tanna", "k", "topaiboul", "investig", "causal", "link", "human", "capit", "open", "trade", "fdi", "econom", "growth", "use", "quarter", "data", "thailand", "period", "1973", "2", "2000", "4", "number", "hypothes", "investig", "includ", "particular", "fdi", "led", "growth", "export", "led", "growth", "well", "revers", "linkag", "growth", "fdi", "export", "import", "human", "capit", "highlight", "complementari", "trade", "fdi", "inflow", "under", "import", "technolog", "adopt", "find", "control", "domest", "invest", "govern", "expenditur", "import", "support", "fdi", "led", "growth", "strong", "export", "led", "growth", "although", "allow", "joint", "interact", "fdi", "human", "capit", "reveal", "posit", "fdi", "effect", "minimum", "threshold", "human", "capit", "estim", "around", "4", "5", "year", "averag", "secondari", "school", "attain", "extend", "studi", "use", "multivari", "causal", "test", "conduct", "within", "vector", "error", "correct", "framework", "also", "find", "signific", "effect", "domest", "invest", "trade", "open", "provid", "support", "import", "led", "growth", "direct", "support", "fdi", "led", "growth", "well", "growth", "led", "fdi", "relat", "weak", "reinforc", "conclus", "trade", "open", "play", "signific", "role", "fdi", "influenc", "thai", "econom", "growth", "result", "reveal", "subtl", "role", "technolog", "transfer", "complementari", "effect", "trade", "fdi", "fdi", "govern", "expenditur", "therebi", "influenc", "human", "capit", "develop", "spillov", "onto", "domest", "invest", "growth", "lead", "us", "argu", "potenti", "role", "fdi", "interact", "human", "capit", "influenc", "futur", "develop", "thai", "economi", "given", "recent", "activ", "polici", "fdi", "promot"]}, "e61d9697-b974-455b-9f0e-4fac674d0d54": {"title": "Measuring value added in higher education: Do any of the recent experiences in secondary education in the United Kingdom suggest a way forward?", "author_name": "Timothy Rodgers", "title_link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/measuring-value-added-in-higher-education-do-any-of-the-recent-ex-2", "date": "2005", "data_desc": "", "filtered_title": ["measur", "valu", "ad", "higher", "educ", "recent", "experi", "secondari", "educ", "unit", "kingdom", "suggest", "way", "forward", "timothi", "rodger"]}, "0dd2cc47-d4de-4e12-9271-67fecc9ab4b3": {"title": "Corporate boards and incentives: Empirical evidence from the UK in 1935", "author_name": "Marianne Pitts, Graham V.

The rate of growth of human capital increased significantly in the period 1972:1-2000:4. We find that, after incorporating human capital, the Solow growth residual is positive and significant during the pre crisis period 1972-1996.

The empirical investigation is initially focused on a matched-pair combination of (public vs. private) firms, mainly in the insurance and banking sectors, but later we also examine the performance of a small number of recently privatised organisations, mainly in the commercial sector. Additionally, we estimate by pooled regression the productivity of labour and capital for an extended group of firms in the financial services industry, and explain the public-private factor productivity differences derived thereof. Although we find some basic underlying efficiency differences between the two groups of firms, it is hard to attribute such differences purely to ownership as other factors like market competition might have played a part.
